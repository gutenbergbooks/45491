</div>

<p class='c007'>“Some of our biggest news stories will break
above the clouds. The skyways are going to
unfold great tales of romance, of daring, possibly
of banditry, but whatever it may be,
we must have the stories. Do you want the
job of getting them?” George Carson, the
sandy-haired managing editor of the Atkinson
News, fired the question at the reporter
standing at the other side of his desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do I want the job?” There was amazement
in Tim Murphy’s voice. “Give me a
plane and I’ll bring you some of the best yarns
you ever printed.” His clean-cut features
were aglow with interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right Tim,” said Carson. “This afternoon
the News will announce the first flying
reporter. I thought you’d like the job. That’s
why we sent you to an aviation school—so
we can have the jump on the Times and the
Journal. They can hire plenty of aviators but
it will take them time to train a first class reporter
to fly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim grinned and his blue eyes snapped.
Even though he was one of the star reporters
on the staff he liked the managing editor’s
indirect compliment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got a plane all ready for you at
the municipal airport,” went on the managing
editor. “It’s one of those new Larks with
a Wasp motor that will take her along at 150
miles an hour. She’s all ready to go. The sky’s
your assignment—go the limit to get your
stories.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim hurried back to his desk where the
half completed story of a down-town fire was
still in his typewriter. He picked up a pad of
notes beside his machine and turned to the
reporter at the next desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Finish up this fire story for me, will you
Ralph? Here’s all the dope and the city editor
wants it for the noon edition.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the big idea?” Ralph Parsons
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Big idea is right,” fairly exploded Tim.
“I’ve got a new job—flying reporter. Carson
has just bought a dandy new plane and
I’m going to pilot it and write the stories.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good, Tim. I don’t blame you for being excited.
It’s a great chance. I’ll finish up the
fire story for you. Will you give me a ride if
I run out after I’m through this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure, Ralph, a dozen if you want them,”
and with that Tim seized his hat and dashed
through the door of the big news room, down
the stairs and into the street where he found
one of the flivvers used by the reporters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fifteen minutes later Tim tucked his elongated
legs into the cockpit of the trimmest
little plane he had ever laid eyes on. He ran
the motor up and down the scale, then gave
it the gun, darted over the surface of the field,
flipped the tail up—and the flying reporter
was in the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a glorious feeling to be in the air—to
be free of the smoke and smell of the city
and for an hour Tim circled over Atkinson.
High, then low, he dived, banked, zoomed
and looped—did everything to test the flying
qualities of the little plane. At the end of the
test flight he was more than pleased. It was
perfectly rigged.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim, an orphan who had joined the News
after school days, had worked up from cub
reporter to the police run and then up to special
assignment writer. He had been sent to
an aviation school three months before and
while there had written a series of Sunday
features on learning how to fly. Tim hadn’t
dreamed of being given a flying assignment
but he had mastered the intricacies of an airplane
with the same wholesome enthusiasm
which characterized everything he did. That
was one of the reasons why he was a star
reporter in spite of his comparative youth,
for Tim had just turned twenty-one.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Lark was still swooping over the field
when one of the cars used by News reporters
dashed through the main gate of the big airport.
Tim cut the motor, made a three point
landing, and climbed out of the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph Parsons hopped out of the car and
ran toward the plane. He shoved an extra
into Tim’s hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“TRANSCONTINENTAL AIR MAIL
ROBBED; $200,000 TAKEN.” The headlines,
in heavy, black type, fairly screamed
the story at Tim. In brief clear sentences he
read how the eastbound mail plane, which
had left Atkinson at midnight, had been
found a hundred miles east near Auburn, a
village in the valley of the Cedar River. The
plane was a mass of tangled wreckage, its
pilot dead, the registered mail sacks looted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Carson says for you to hump yourself and
get over there before dark,” said Ralph. “He
wants a lot of copy for the early editions tomorrow.
The roads over that way are practically
impassable and we can’t get enough of
the details over the telephone. The air mail
people are sending out a ship but we don’t
know when they’ll be back. It’s bad country
to fly over, Tim, so be careful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph’s well meant warning was lost on
Tim. Calling a mechanic, the lanky young
flyer swung his ship around, opened up the
powerful motor, and sped down the field and
into the air. The flying reporter was off on
his first assignment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The air was smooth and cool. The late
winter sun glinted through the lazy clouds
in the west and flashed off the crimson wings
of the little plane. Tim headed straight east.
Far behind him the Great Smokies reared
their heads in a dim outline while a hundred
miles ahead of his whirling propeller the Cedar
River carved its way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Atkinson, with its bustling streets, its busy
factories and 200,000 inhabitants, was soon
left behind. For almost an hour Tim held to
his course. When he sighted the silver ribbon
that was the Cedar River, he swung south until
he picked up the village of Auburn. It was
little more than a cluster of houses on the
right bank of the mighty river.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no regular landing field at the
village but Tim found a pasture a mile back
from the river that looked large enough for
his purpose. He stalled down, taking his time.
There was no use risking a crackup with his
new ship. The pasture was cuppy and there
was a slough on one side but Tim killed his
speed quickly after he set the Lark down and
pulled up less than twenty feet from a fence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had sighted the wreck of the air mail
in a timber patch half way to the village.
After landing his own craft it took him less
than ten minutes to find what was left of
the mail. There was little in the pile of wreckage
to resemble the sturdy, silver craft which
had left the Atkinson airport the night before.
It was just a heap of tangled wires
and struts, scraps of canvas and twisted rods.
It looked like a crackup, with the mail looted
after the smash, but to Tim’s carefully trained
news sense there was something more. He
couldn’t have defined his feelings in so many
words but he played his hunch and examined
the remains of the big plane. He had almost
completed his examination when something on
the motor caught his attention. He bent over
it and when he straightened up there was a
new gleam of interest in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the aid of a farm boy Tim managed
to get a fence post under the motor and half
rolled it over. A few minutes more of hard
work and he succeeded in removing several
parts from the engine.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the time the flying reporter had completed
his task the light was fading fast and,
satisfied with his survey of the wrecked plane,
Tim hurried toward the village.</p>

<p class='c008'>Auburn was small but friendly and he soon
found out what little the residents of the
valley knew.</p>

<p class='c008'>The east bound mail usually roared over the
village about 1 o’clock in the morning, speeding
through the night at better than one hundred
miles an hour. But that morning the
mail plane had failed to go over. That, in itself,
was not unusual, for occasionally bad
weather forced the cancellation of the trip.
Tim, by careful inquiries, learned that one
old man, living about two miles from the village,
had heard the sound of a motor. His
attention had been attracted by the high-pitched
drone for the song of the mail was a
heavy throbbing that once heard is seldom forgotten.</p>

<p class='c008'>It had been mid-day before a farmer had
found the wreckage of the mail, its pilot
trapped in the cockpit, the registered mail
sacks, with a big shipment of currency, looted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had enough material for his first story.
Using the one long distance telephone wire
in the village, he got in touch with the News
office in Atkinson and dictated a detailed
story. To spice it up, he added a hint about a
mystery plane. It would make good reading.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter had scarcely finished
telephoning when the heavy throbbing of the
motor of a plane echoed from the clouds.
Hurrying out into the street from the telephone
office, Tim could discern the riding
lights of a mail plane as the pilot, hunting
for a place to land, circled over the village.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim hired a car and sped toward the
make-shift field where he had managed to
land his own plane. When he reached the pasture
he hastily piled some brush at one end of
the field and set it afire. Then he raced for
the other end and swung the car around so
that its headlights outlined the far boundary
of the pasture.</p>

<p class='c008'>The roar of the mail plane’s motor lessened
as its pilot cut his throttle and brought
his craft down to earth. The big ship bounced
and swayed, threatening once or twice to
nose over, but the mail flyer jammed his
wheel brakes on hard and succeeded in stopping
before he crashed into the fence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim left the car and hurried to meet the
newcomer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That you, Tim?” boomed a deep voice
from the cockpit of the mail ship as the new
arrival shut off his motor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim smiled. The voice was familiar and
Tiny Lewis, who weighed some 250 pounds,
eased his bulk gently to the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks a lot, Tim,” he roared. “I was
sure in a pickle. Figured on getting here before
dark but made a forced landing about
50 miles back when two of the spark plugs
fouled and I had to replace them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before starting for the village, Tim and
Lewis put tarpaulins over the motors of their
planes and staked them securely lest some
freakish wind upset their craft.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they reached the little hotel and had
ordered their dinner, Tim told Lewis all he
knew about the wreck of the air mail. When
he had completed his story, Tiny whistled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks bad,” he admitted, “and I guess
there isn’t much that I can do except make
arrangements here for them to crate up
what’s left of the plane and ship it in to Atkinson.
The post office inspectors will be here
sometime tomorrow and they’ll take charge
of the investigation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I expected they’d be on hand,” said Tim,
“but I’ve got a little hunch all my own I’m
going to see through to the finish. If it works
out as I hope, it will be a real scoop for the
News.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s wishing you luck, Tim,” said
Tiny. “I’m going to roll in now. I flew in
from the west today with the mail and then
they sent me on out here. It’s been a long
day but I’ll see you the first thing in the morning.
Good night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good night, Tiny,” replied Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the mail flyer had lumbered up to
his room, Tim went out to the hotel porch
where he had laid the salvaged parts from
the engine. He picked them up and lugged
them up to his room. There, under the yellow
light from a kerosene lamp, he strained over
the broken bits. When he finally completed
his minute examination, there was a grim
smile on his lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>After breakfast with Lewis the next morning,
Tim phoned the News office, and putting
a bug in the managing editor’s ear that he
had stumbled onto a real clue, got permission
to free lance for the rest of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim carefully wrapped up the engine parts
and carried them to the field where he loaded
them into his plane. Lewis was busy supervising
operations for the crating and shipping
of the remains of the mail plane and with a
wave of his hand, Tim dodged over the trees
that bordered the pasture and headed for
Prairie City, two hundred miles away, where
the state university was located.</p>

<p class='c008'>Noon found Tim closeted with the head
of the engineering school of the university,
an international authority on electricity. Tim
told his story in quick, clear sentences and in
less than fifteen minutes the famous scientist
had a graphic picture of what must have
taken place in the midnight sky over the Cedar
River valley.</p>

<p class='c008'>For two hours the flying reporter and the
scientist worked behind closed doors while
messenger boys hurried to and from the
telegraph offices, delivering telegrams that were
eagerly grasped and hastily opened.</p>

<p class='c008'>By late afternoon Tim was winging his
way back to Atkinson, a smile of conquest
lighting up his face. In his pocket was a
paper with the secret of the destruction of
the air mail plane, in his mind was a plan to
catch the sky bandits.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim reached Atkinson and entered
the big editorial office of the News, he found
it deserted for it was early evening and the
staff on an afternoon newspaper completes
its work before 6 o’clock. A scrub woman,
busy at one end of the long room, paid no
attention to the flying reporter as he sat
down at his desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim sat before his battered typewriter until
far into the night, recording his strange
story. He told how the mail plane, speeding
through the night over the valley of the Cedar
River, had fallen earthward in a death spin,
its motor silent, its pilot paralyzed in his seat
while over the twisting, falling plane hovered
its destroyer.</p>

<p class='c008'>In glowing language he pictured the scene
that must have taken place. A plane loitering
in the night over the hills and valleys of the
Cedar River in the path of the air mail. Then
the red and green lights of the mail as it
flashed out of the west, a quickening of the
vulture’s motor, a short dash through the
night, a flash of invisible death, the mail plane
careening down—a dead and fluttering thing.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Tim wrote more, much more—of how
he had found the motor of the mail plane a
congealed mass, the pilot’s body a husk of a
man, burned by a powerful but invisible electric
ray.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still Tim went on. He told how the invisible
ray recently invented and of which little
was known, could be shot from a small gun.
He described how he had consulted the famous
scientist at the state university and
how together they had found that one of
the few invisible ray guns in existence had
been stolen. This, concluded Tim, must be the
weapon of the sky pirates.</p>

<p class='c008'>From then on Tim conjectured as to how
one of the men in the bandit plane must have
taken to his parachute and followed the mail
earthward, robbed the registered pouches of
their fortune in currency, and escaped in a
waiting car.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had just completed his story and was
reading it over for corrections when the lights
all over the editorial room flashed on and the
managing editor, who had dropped in on
his way home from a theater, trotted up to
his desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carson was reputed to be capable of scenting
a good story a mile away and he devoured
Tim’s copy, but not without evident astonishment
and several open expressions of his admiration
for the flying reporter’s work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s great stuff, Tim, great stuff,” exclaimed
the managing editor when he had
finished reading the story. “I’m glad I dropped
in tonight. I’ll edit it now and schedule it
for the early mail editions tomorrow. It will
certainly set the town talking.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish you wouldn’t print that story tomorrow,
Mr. Carson,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>The managing editor, who had started for
his desk, spun on his heels.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And why not?” he demanded. “Didn’t you
just tell me it was all right?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The story is all right, Mr. Carson,” explained
Tim? “but if you print it tomorrow
the gang responsible for the robbery of the
air mail will never be captured. If you’ll hold
the story for twenty-four hours there’s a
good chance that they can be apprehended.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not much,” snorted the managing editor,
“at least not as long as they have the death
ray machine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re wrong there,” persisted Tim. “It’s
not only possible that they can be captured,
but if you’ll give me permission to use the
News’ plane I think I can turn the trick.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carson was too surprised for words and
before the managing editor could regain his
poise Tim continued, driving his argument
home. For over an hour they talked in low,
strained voices, with Carson openly protesting
at times as Tim explained his plan. Finally
the managing editor gave his consent
and Tim arose to go.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good luck, Tim,” said Carson, “I’ll see
the air mail people the first thing in the morning
and fix everything up for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dead tired, Tim went to his room and
turned in, but sleep would not come. Through
the rest of the night his mind pictured the
lurking bandit plane, the helpless mail flyer,
the death ray fired from the gun, and then
the bandit drifting earthward to feast on the
spoils of the wreckage. Tim turned and tossed,
enraged that men should stoop to such
villainy, that an achievement of science should be
turned to such low ends.</p>

<p class='c008'>All next day Tim and a crew of mechanics
at the municipal field worked desperately on
the Lark in a secluded hangar. Carefully they
sheathed the motor cowling and the fuselage
with thin layers of lead and zinc, alternately
spreading them on for they were as thin as
paper. By nightfall the crimson plane was
half gray with the cockpit and its vital parts
protected by the thin sheathing of metal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Lark was ready for the test and the
chances were that it would come that night.
The two previous nights had been clear as
crystal with a full moon riding the sky. The
pilots of the mysterious vulture of the air
would not be abroad on such nights for the
risk of detection would be too great. Now,
however, a thin cloud film at high altitude
had spread over the heavens, making an ideal
night for another raid on the air mail. And
there was no doubt in Tim’s mind but that
they would raid again. They had not the
slightest reason to believe that their secret
had been discovered and certainly the valuables
carried nightly by the mail plane would
lure them into further attacks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, Tim was ready for them, but the
thought of actually doing battle in the air
gave him many a nervous chill as he waited
that evening for the time to go into action.</p>

<p class='c008'>A figure hurried across the field and toward
the hangar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tim! Tim!” called an anxious voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Ralph. Where are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here at the southeast corner of the
hangar. Look out you don’t fall into the
ditch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say Tim, what are you up to to-night?”
demanded Ralph as he panted up to the hangar.
“There are all kinds of wild rumors
floating around the office. Carson’s sitting at
his desk watching the clock and getting whiter
every minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to catch the gang that robbed
the mail the other night,” said Tim quietly.
He hoped that his voice did not betray his
emotion for inwardly he was seething with
excitement. The waiting was what got on
his nerves. He was tense, eager to be in the
air and away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had a sneaking idea that’s what you
were up to,” said Ralph. “Count me in on the
expedition,” he continued. “I stopped at the
police station and borrowed one of Chief Flaherty’s
riot guns.” From beneath the topcoat
which protected him from the raw night air,
Ralph produced a sawed-off shot gun, capable
of scattering a veritable hail of lead in
whatever direction it was aimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim laughed heartily at his friend’s determination
but his next words were not easy
to say. Ralph and Tim had worked on many a
story together and their bond of friendship
was close, but Tim could not afford to risk
any life other than his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry, Ralph,” he said, “but I can’t
take you along tonight. You’re not used to
flying, and, besides, this is a one man game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Tim, something might happen to
you,” protested Ralph.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Something might,” conceded Tim, “and
then what would you do a couple of thousand
feet up in the air and traveling at 100 miles
an hour? No, Ralph, not to-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The roar of the mail coming in from the
west halted their conversation and Tim turned
to direct the work of the mechanics while
Ralph, realizing his helplessness, watched the
final preparations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just as the mail trundled to a stop the
lights on the field blinked out. There were
shouts and calls for flashlights and a minute
or two later the mechanics started their work
of servicing the plane. In ten minutes it was
ready to continue its eastward flight.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pilot, slouched in his cockpit, waved for
the mechanics to pull the blocks and gave his
ship full throttle. Down the field he sped,
then leaped into the air. His riding lights
were disappearing in the east when the field
beacons flashed on again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Speeding into the night at one hundred
miles an hour, Tim looked back and chuckled.
In place of the regular mail plane, his own
trim, fast little craft was rocketing eastward
with dummy sacks of mail. It had been carefully
camouflaged to look like the regular
plane and when the lights went out, the larger
ship had been pushed into a hangar and Tim’s
wheeled out in its place.</p>

<p class='c008'>In less than another hour Tim would know
just how good his theory and plans had been.
He was willing to stake his life on them. The
night air was exhilarating. Tim didn’t want
to die; in fact, he had no intention of doing so.
As he raced through the scudding clouds, he
carefully checked his plans. Ahead of him two
long black machine guns peered over the edge
of the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c008'>For nearly an hour the racy little ship flew
through the half clear night. When Tim
sighted the curving light line that was the
Cedar River, he eased the throttle. His greatest
assignment was just ahead—if the air
raiders were waiting!</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim cut his speed to that of the regular
mail plane. His riding lights glowed brightly.
The young flyer tensed; eager for the test.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whrrrrrrr! A roaring black plane flashed
from the clouds above, it powerful motor
spitting flame. Tim’s heart leaped. His mind
was racing madly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The black plane bore down on him. Tim
ducked, and the vulture of the skies stormed
past. Tim’s own plane held its course. He
had escaped from the invisible death. Instead
of falling, a wisp of humanity in a lifeless
plane, he was hard on the tail of the bandits’
plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim pushed his little craft hard. The bandits,
amazed that the first attempt had failed,
were startled when the usually sluggish mail
doubled its speed and took after them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gap between the two planes closed
rapidly. Tim, crouched behind his guns and
protected from the invisible rays by the lead
and zinc which covered the cockpit, waited.
Ahead loomed the black plane, its two astonished
occupants glancing back at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim tripped his machine guns and a stream
of tracer bullets, singing their song of death,
streaked the blackness of night with threads
of sparkling crimson as they coursed through
the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>The black plane dodged this way and that,
but always Tim was at their heels. He flew
with the fury of a man possessed. Again and
again it seemed as though the black plane
must be destroyed by the leaden hail but each
time its pilot managed to escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim zoomed quickly, the nose of his ship
pointing into the belly of the bandit craft.
Suddenly, with a grinding chatter, his guns
jammed and his exultation became maddening
disappointment. The chased became the
chaser, and Tim was now on the defensive.</p>

<p class='c008'>His plane had withstood one attack of the
death ray but a second time the bandits might
find a vulnerable spot. The pilot of the black
ship quickly realized that Tim’s guns had
jammed and that his nervy pursuer was at
his mercy. He lost no time in banking swiftly
to make quick work of Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter, a desperate plan in his
mind, cut his motor and drifted. It was his
only chance and Tim staked the success of
his midnight venture on a slender possibility.
The bandit plane was storming down on him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Tim ducked, again the breathless
moment and again the thin covering of lead
and zinc saved him from death.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bandits, completely bewildered by the
plane and pilot who defied destruction, slowed
down. It was Tim’s chance. Savagely he
jammed the throttle on full. The Lark leaped
and quivered, a roaring, pulsating king of
the air. It was eating up the space separating
the two planes. Tim’s brain was in a whirl.
Did he dare, would he succeed, what would
happen if he failed? But the die was cast; he
was almost on the black destroyer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hastily he loosened his safety belt, climbed
to the edge of the cockpit and before the
startled bandits could aim their death ray
gun at him, leaped into space.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the planes crashed. As Tim floated
downward, his parachute billowing out above,
he heard the scream of breaking wires, the
crash of struts, the last wild, defiant roar of
speeding motors as his own plane ate its way
into the other. To his left Tim could see two
other parachutes drifting earthward. The
bandits had not been caught in the crash!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c009'>CHAPTER TWO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>While the parachutes floated down through
the night, Tim realized that things were not
turning out the way he had expected. He
hoped the posse which was supposed to be
in readiness at Auburn had seen the battle in
the sky and was ready to do its part now.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim spilled some of the air from his parachute
to speed his descent. He must reach
the ground ahead of the bandits. If the posse
wasn’t on the job, he might be able to handle
the situation alone. Below him a heavy patch
of timber loomed in the night. He jerked
hard on the chute cords and, kicking desperately
with his legs, swung away from the
trees and dropped into a small clearing. Over
to his right he could see the other two parachutes
settling to earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter unsnapped his parachute
harness, made sure that his gun was
ready, and then sprinted toward the place
where he had last seen the parachutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a rushing, moaning sound that
stopped Tim in his tracks. For the moment
he had forgotten the two planes. Locked
together, they had swung in great circles in
the sky and the flyers, who had leaped in the
chutes, had beaten them to the ground. Now,
in a last tragic circle, the planes were hovering
over the trees. For a moment they hung
in the sky. Then, with a final flirt of their
tails, stuck their noses down and the next
moment struck the ground with terrific impact.
There was a flash of fire and the roar
of bursting fuel tanks. In a moment both
planes were masses of flame.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim groaned at the thought of his beloved
Lark coming to such an end and he hurried
on with renewed determination. A hundred
yards on the other side of the burning planes
he came to an open field. Two irregular
masses of white were laying near the center
while on the far side Tim could distinguish
the forms of two men, running toward a
nearby road.</p>

<p class='c008'>He heard the sputter of a powerful engine,
headlights flashed on and before he was a
third of the way across the field a car, with
the two aerial bandits in it, was speeding
down the valley away from the village of
Auburn.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the posse arrived five minutes later
they found Tim waiting for them at the side of
the road. Briefly he explained what had happened
and then went to Auburn where he
telephoned his story to the News office.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the next afternoon when Tim
reached Atkinson and he half way expected
a bawling out from Carson for the loss of his
new plane. Instead, he found the managing
editor jubilant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Best story we’ve had in months, Tim,”
congratulated Carson. “And the Transcontinental
is going to replace our plane so you
can go cloud-hopping again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad you liked the story,” replied Tim,
“And it’s great of the Transcontinental people
to buy a new plane, but I felt I sort of fell
down on the story. I should have caught those
fellows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense,” exploded the managing editor.
“It wasn’t your fault the posse wasn’t on the
job. You did everything you could.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know,” said Tim, “but it makes a
fellow’s blood boil to think of flyers who will
stoop as low as that pair. Besides, they’re
apt to try the stunt again. Not with the death
ray but with something else. The airways
aren’t patrolled like the highways and some
mighty valuable cargoes are carried by plane
these days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kind of riles up your Irish pride at the
thought of them getting away, doesn’t it?”
asked Carson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess it does,” admitted Tim, “but you
don’t want to be too sure they’ve gotten away.
Next time it will be a different story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope there isn’t a next time,” said the
managing editor, and he picked up the handful
of copy he had been reading when Tim
came in.</p>

<p class='c008'>News is news but for a day and then it
fades from the front pages to become only
a matter for memory, and so it was with Tim’s
adventure with the sky bandits.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a few hours he received the praise of
his fellow reporters. Then his deed was forgotten
in the hurry and bustle that is part
of a great daily newspaper. Tim would not
have wished it otherwise. He had no desire
to be a hero, even in the News office, and
considered the entire incident as nothing
more than a part of his duty, for reporting
takes its followers into many a situation which
calls for quick thinking and steady nerves.</p>

<p class='c008'>In less than two weeks the new plane which
the Transcontinental Air Mail company had
agreed to buy to replace the one wrecked by
Tim in the Cedar River valley arrived and
was uncrated at the municipal field. The mechanics
were busy several days assembling
the plane and another day was required for
the ground tests.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Tim was ready to soar into the clouds
again. The test flight was successful and the
flying reporter was highly elated with the
new Lark. He was ready to follow new trails
through the sky in his quest for the news of
the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>One morning a copy boy stopped at his
desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say Tim, Mr. Carson wants to see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim’s slender fingers stopped their tattoo
on the keys of his typewriter. Anchoring his
notes securely under a piece of lead he used
for a paper weight, he left his desk and
walked down the aisle in the center of the big
news room. At one end, on a slightly elevated
platform, were the desks of the managing
editor and the city editor, so located that the
executives in charge of the paper could see
at a glance just what reporters were in the
room. Directly in front of the platform was
a large, horseshoe shaped desk where half
a dozen copyreaders were busy editing stories
which were to go into the editions that
day. At the center of the horseshoe sat the
head copyreader, a gray-haired veteran by
the name of Dan Watkins, who could spin
many a yarn of the early days.</p>

<p class='c008'>The copyreaders, engrossed with their
work, did not look up as Tim passed by.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit down, Tim,” said the managing editor,
and he waved the flying reporter to a chair
beside his desk. For a minute Carson was busy
with the makeup editor, completing the final
layout for the first page of the mail edition
for that day. The layout finished, he turned
to Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m well satisfied,” he commenced, “with
the way you’re handling our plane. There’s
just one thing, though, Tim. Sometime you
may not be able to take the controls and then
we’ll be up against it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you could get any one of half a dozen
reliable pilots at the municipal field to fly for
you in an emergency,” suggested Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know it,” replied Carson, “but I want
more than pilots. I want flying reporters.
When I first gave you the assignment of
handling our new plane, I felt sure that many of
the big stories of the future will be in the air.
Now I’m more convinced than ever. What I
want is another flying reporter; someone that
can take your place if need be. I want you
to pick your man from the staff and devote
the next few weeks to teaching him how to
fly. I’ve made arrangements with the manager
of the municipal field to give you whatever
assistance you need.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s fine, Mr. Carson,” said Tim enthusiastically.
“Does this mean you want me
to take three or four weeks and give all my
time to teaching someone on the staff to fly?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right, Tim,” said the managing editor.
“Have you any suggestions? Pick your man
carefully,” he added, “for we have a heavy
investment in that plane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe Ralph Parsons could be trained
to fly,” suggested Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But isn’t Ralph a little too slow for this
game in the air?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ralph may be a little slow in learning,”
admitted Tim, “but he’s steady and that
counts a lot in flying. On top of that, Ralph
is a brilliant and clever writer. I’m sure he
would fit into your scheme of things nicely.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, Tim,” agreed Carson, “if you
think Ralph can handle the job we’ll give him
a try. When he comes into the office tell him
I want to see him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Half an hour later Ralph breezed in from
his round of the hotels. Without betraying
anything unusual in his voice, Tim accosted
his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ralph, Mr. Carson wants to see you right
away. It’s important.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph frowned. “Wonder what’s up now,”
he said, as he started for the managing editor’s
desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim smiled for he knew how his chum
would feel when he returned from the interview
with Carson.</p>

<p class='c008'>Five minutes later Ralph fairly ran down
the room to Tim’s desk. He was bubbling
with excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t you tell me what he wanted,”
he exploded. “Gosh, Tim, I’m so tickled I
hardly know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m mighty glad, too,” said Tim. “It’s a
great opportunity and I know you’ll make
good. We’re to take three or four weeks and
go in for an intensive course.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When they reached the municipal field the
next morning, Tim took Ralph to the office
where he introduced him to Carl Hunter, the
genial manager of the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you’re going to be the new flying reporter,”
smiled Hunter as he greeted Ralph.
“That’s great. Tim phoned me yesterday and
I’ve got a ship all ready and waiting on the
line for you chaps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph was a little disappointed when he
saw the craft in which he was to take his
first lesson. It was an antiquated machine
whose exact number of years were unknown.
Suffice to say that it was classed as a “Jenny,”
a type of biplane used by the army in training
it’s flyers in the days of the World War.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Jenny’s wings drooped a little dejectedly
and her fuselage was liberally
patched and doped but the motor, which was
turning over slowly, sounded sweet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everything O.K.?” asked Hunter as Tim
completed his examination of the plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks like it,” said the flying reporter, as
he turned to his chum to explain the intricacies
of a seat pack parachute. With the heavy
package banging around his knees, Ralph
climbed into the rear cockpit. The instruments
there looked sensible enough to him.
A gas gauge to indicate the amount of fuel,
an altimeter to show the height, an oil gauge
to show that the motor was getting the proper
amount of lubrication and a tachometer which
indicated the number of revolutions of the
motor per minute.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was getting Ralph acclimated to the
cockpit and he intentionally kept the motor
idling while he explained the functions of the
controls; how the rudder at the back of the
fuselage controlled the right and left direction
of the plane while the ailerons on the
wings were used to direct it’s up and down
movements. The explanation seemed simple
enough to Ralph and when he placed his feet
on the rudder bar it recalled days not so long
gone when he had guided a speeding sled
down long hills. This might not be so bad,
after all, but he admitted a few qualms when
Tim climbed into the forward cockpit,
strapped himself in, revved up the motor,
waggled the wings, and sent the plane throbbing
into the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph needed some time to get used to the
sensation of roaring along through the clouds
at eighty miles an hour and for the first fifteen
or twenty minutes Tim made no effort
to give his chum any further instructions.
Instead, they conversed freely through the
headphones and Tim took pains to keep
Ralph’s attention diverted from the plane and
its maneuvering. When he felt that his chum
had become more air-minded he started the
actual instruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph was slow to learn the rudiments of
handling the plane, but he was steady and
after another half hour in the air, Tim took
his hands off the controls and signalled for
Ralph to take the stick. Everything went
well for several minutes until they struck an
air pocket and the ship dropped fifty feet.
Ralph, surprised at the sinking sensation,
overcontrolled and threw the Jenny into a
side-slip.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim righted the plane and continued the
instruction for another ten minutes. Then
he started down, calling Ralph’s attention to
every shift in the position of the controls and
explaining his reason.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they skimmed to a stop in front of
the office at the field they were stiff and numb
from cold for the late winter winds had bitten
through their heavy clothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter was on hand to greet them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How goes it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fine, Carl, fine,” said Tim. “Ralph will
make a cracking good flyer when he gets over
being scared. We’ll be out again this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Three weeks slipped away and to Ralph
and Tim the time was like three days. Then
Ralph was ready for his solo flight. He had
satisfied both Tim and Hunter that he could
handle a plane and that morning, late in
March, he was to soar aloft alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph, silent and serious of face, took his
place in the Jenny. He heard Tim yell a few
reassuring words at him. Then he was off.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph got the Jenny off the ground like a
veteran and started climbing for altitude.
At 2,000 feet he levelled off and swung the
Jenny over the field in great circles, his motor
barking in the crisp morning air. For fifteen
minutes Tim and Hunter strained their necks
as they watched Ralph put the Jenny through
her paces.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s all right,” said Hunter, “you’ve done
a nice piece of work, Tim, in teaching him
how to fly. I was afraid he wouldn’t be fast
enough in an emergency.” When the manager
of the Atkinson field said a flyer was all right,
he was that and more, for Hunter was known
as a cautious man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim and Hunter turned to glance at another
ship that was being warmed up on the
line. A shout from a mechanic brought their
attention back to Ralph, and their faces went
white at the sight of what was happening in
the sky. Far above them the Jenny was twisting
and falling. For a moment they were
speechless.</p>

<p class='c008'>“His right wing’s crumpled,” yelled
Hunter. “He’s going to crash.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim’s throat tightened. He couldn’t even
speak when he realized what Ralph was up
against. It was enough to turn a veteran pilot
gray headed, much less a beginner making
his first solo.</p>

<p class='c008'>If Ralph could keep the Jenny out of a tail
spin he had a chance, just a chance. Down,
down, down, fluttered the crippled plane, so
slowly and yet so swiftly. Nearer and nearer
the field Ralph swung his battered ship, nursing
it every foot of the way. At 500 feet it
fell away in a steep glide—so steep that the
two near the hangar held their breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plane gained speed, the sideslip was
steeper. In another second it would strike
the ground, roll over, and crush its pilot. Tim
turned away; he couldn’t stand it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Only Hunter saw Ralph stake his life in
a desperate chance and saw him win. Just before
the plane crashed he threw his controls
over, bringing his left wing up and levelling
off. The lower right wing held for the needed
fraction of a second, just the time required
to pull out of the sideslip, and Ralph set his
crippled plane down hard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of a bad crash, it was only a noseover
and by the time Tim and Hunter reached
the Jenny, Ralph was scrambling out of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurt, Ralph?” cried Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not hurt, just scared,” he grinned. “Guess
I kind of smashed up the old bus, Carl,” he
went on, his words tense and close clipped.
“I’m mighty sorry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right, Ralph,” said Hunter.
“She was about at the end of her string and
I guess I shouldn’t have let you take her up
for your solo. I’m glad it wasn’t any worse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you feel coming down?” queried
Tim, as they started back to the office
after a careful survey of the wrecked Jenny.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pretty nervous,” admitted Ralph, “but it’s
great stuff. I’d have been all right if I hadn’t
hit a bump when I went into a sharp bank
and the old ship just couldn’t stand the gaff.
It was some trip down, though. I thought I
had a ticket straight through for China.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That landing with the broken wing was a
great piece of flying,” cut in Hunter in his
quiet voice. Ralph was thrilled, for words of
praise from the manager of the field meant
much.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better come out this afternoon,” said
Hunter when they reached the office, “and
we’ll have another try at it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim caught the significance of the words
and he wondered if Ralph sensed their meaning.
After a crash the first thing for a flyer
to do is to get into the air again. If he lets
the effects of the crackup work on his nerves
he may never be able to handle a plane again.
Tim realized that his chum had been through
a severe flying ordeal but he was elated that
Ralph had come through in such fine shape.
The next thing was to get him back into the
air as soon as possible and in the meantime
to keep his mind occupied with thoughts other
than those of the crackup.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were speeding into town in one of
the cars owned by the News when Ralph let
out a yell and Tim swerved just in time to
avoid a hog which was having a hard time
making up its mind in which way to go.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One thing,” laughed Ralph when the pork
menace was safely behind, “we don’t have to
dodge such things up there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim purposely took Ralph to the busiest
cafeteria in town where the rush to get food
kept them busy for half an hour. The heavy
tide of noonday traffic caught them in its
swirl when they started back to the field and
by the time they reached the airport, they
had said scarcely a dozen words about the incident
of the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter, wise in the ways of the air and
the men who ride through its trackless lanes,
had another plane warmed up on the line when
they put in their appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the work of only a few minutes for
Ralph to don his heavy flying clothes. Tim
thought his chum looked a little white around
his lips. He wondered what thoughts were
racing through Ralph’s mind. If his chum
only knew it, the big test was before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim wanted Ralph to make good, wanted
him to pass the next ordeal for he knew how
much he had counted on becoming a companion
of the flying reporter. They had worked
up from cub reporter, taken all the hard
knocks of the newspaper game with a smile.
Now their big opportunity was at hand if
Ralph could come through the gruelling test
of the afternoon. Tim knew he must go on
flying even if Ralph failed, but the zest of
it would be gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph took his place in the cockpit of the
ship Hunter designated. It was similar to the
old Jenny in design but a much sturdier type.
Tim watched Ralph closely as he checked over
the instruments. If Ralph was upset or unnerved
at the thought of taking the air so
soon after his first crackup, he gave no sign
other than a certain firmness to the lines
around his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a roar, Ralph went scudding down
the field, bouncing from side to side. Tim felt
chills of apprehension running up and down
his back as Ralph jounced along. There was
little in his handling of the plane to resemble
the fine takeoff of the morning. But just before
Ralph crashed into the fence at the other
side of the airport, he pulled the stick back
hard.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little ship shot skyward in a breathtaking
climb; almost straight up it seemed to
the anxious watchers on the field. For a second
it hung at the peak of its climb. Would it
fall off into a spin or would the sturdy motor
pull on through? For an eternity the plane
was hanging almost vertically against the
sky—then the nose came down, the tail went
up, and Ralph started circling the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Ralph put his plane through its
paces and as far as Tim and Hunter could
see, his handling of the craft showed no sign
of uncertainty. At the end of half an hour he
had completed every maneuver and even more
than is required of a pilot on his solo flight
but instead of coming down, Ralph continued
to circle the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>For ten or fifteen minutes Tim thought
little of his chum’s actions but before the hour
was up he was genuinely worried. What
could be keeping Ralph up? he asked himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter dodged out of the office to scan the
sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s Ralph doing up there so long?”
he asked Tim in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know, Carl,” replied the flying reporter,
lines of worry creasing his brow. “I’m
going to warm up the Lark and hop up and
see if anything is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In less than ten minutes, Tim, in the Lark,
was pulling up beside Ralph’s plane. Tim was
astonished at the sight which greeted his
eyes. Apparently the training plane was a
ghost ship, flying without human hands at
its controls. Ralph was nowhere to be seen!
But the movements of the ailerons and the
rudder indicated that someone was in the
cockpit and Tim wondered what kind of a
joke Ralph was trying to play on him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two planes circled lazily over the airport
and when several minutes elapsed and
Ralph still remained hidden in the cockpit,
Tim felt new alarm. He let the Lark drop
behind the training plane, then gave it the
gun and climbed above Ralph’s ship so he
could look down into the cockpit.</p>

<p class='c008'>He could see Ralph, doubled up on the
floor at one side of the cockpit, controlling
the plane as best he could with his hands.
Ralph evidently heard the deeper roar of the
motor of Tim’s plane for he looked up and
managed to wave one hand. His face was
twisted with pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter waved back at his
chum, then threw the Lark into a sideslip
and plunged madly for the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter heard the thunder of the Lark as
Tim sent it earthward in a power dive and
was waiting for the flying reporter when he
checked his plane on the concrete apron in
front of the office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Something’s happened to Ralph,” yelled
Tim. “He’s slumped down in one corner of
the cockpit. Evidently he can’t use his legs
for he’s handling the controls with his hands.
We’ve got to get him down some way or he’ll
crash sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter glanced at his watch. “He’s been
up nearly an hour and a half and I didn’t
put much gas in that ship,” he muttered half
to himself and half to Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim slipped into the forward cockpit and
yelled for Hunter to take the controls. A mechanic
helped them whip the Lark around and
get it headed down the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter opened the throttle wide. The Lark
had its tail off the ground in a hundred feet
and in less than five hundred feet was pointing
its nose into the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>While they fought for altitude, Tim slipped
the harness of his parachute from his
shoulders. He couldn’t afford to be hampered by
anything as cumbersome as a parachute if
his plan to save Ralph from crashing was to
succeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim and Hunter quickly overtook Ralph’s
plane and that young man, despite the seriousness
of his predicament, managed to grin at
them as they jockeyed for a position directly
over him.</p>

<p class='c008'>While Hunter was coordinating the speed
of the Lark with that of the training plane,
Tim slipped out of his seat and down onto
the wing. From the lower wing it was the
work of a minute to wrap his legs around the
landing gear and slide down onto the axle below
the plane. If Hunter could bring the Lark
down close enough to Ralph’s ship, Tim planned
to drop onto the upper wing of the training
plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Lark was hovering over Ralph’s ship
when the motor of the lower plane coughed
once or twice and died. Not more than fifteen
feet separated Tim from Ralph but it
might just as well have been a mile. The
training plane, its motor dead, was rapidly
falling away from the Lark in spite of Hunter’s
best efforts!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c009'>CHAPTER THREE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Tim yelled until it seemed his lungs would
burst but the roar of the Lark’s own powerful
motor drowned out his cries. Finally
Ralph, who had been working desperately in
the cockpit of his own plane, looked up at his
chum. Death was staring him in the face,
but there was no hint of fear in the eyes that
gazed at Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter signalled Ralph to
reach for the lever which opened the emergency
gas tank. If there was fuel in the reserve
tank, the motor might catch again and
they would have another chance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lever which controlled the valve of the
emergency tank was on the other side of the
cockpit and Tim, hanging on his precarious
perch, watched his chum strain to reach it.
Ralph lunged toward the lever and his outstretched
hands knocked it open. The fuel
flooded down into the carburetor and hissed
into the red hot cylinders. With a quiver the
engine of the training plane came to life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim couldn’t restrain a shout as he saw
Ralph gain control of the plane again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter lost no time in bringing the ships
together and the Lark crept down and over
the upper wing of Ralph’s plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim steeled himself for the attempt. He had
never tried to change from one plane to another
but he had watched the stunt a dozen
times. The feat looked easy then, but actually
to attempt it with a friend’s life in the balance
was an entirely different thing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just ahead Tim could see the flashing arc
of the propeller of Ralph’s plane. If Hunter
misjudged the distance, if they struck a
bump, if—if any one of half a dozen things
happened he might be thrown into the deadly
whirl. But Hunter was a master pilot and——</p>

<p class='c008'>Before Tim’s madly racing mind could
conjure up other thoughts they were over
Ralph’s plane. Six feet, five feet, four feet
separated the under carriage of the Lark from
the upper wing of the training ship. Tim released
his hold on the axle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next moment the air was forced from
his lungs as he sprawled against the surface
of the wing. His desperately reaching fingers
hooked themselves over the wires along the
upper edge of the wing and he was safe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was stiff from the cold and bruised
by his fall but he swiftly made his way in
from the tip of the wing and crawled down
into the forward cockpit. His action was not
a moment too soon for the supply of fuel in
the reserve tank was exhausted. He grabbed
the dual controls in the forward cockpit and
within thirty seconds had set the plane down
on the field. Hunter, who had beaten him
down, ran toward him and together they
clambered into the rear cockpit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph’s face was drawn with lines of pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess I’ve made a supreme mess of
things,” he gritted, before they could ask him
what had happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>A doctor who had been summoned by one
of the mechanics when Tim and Hunter went
aloft, shoved Hunter aside and slipped into
the cockpit beside Ralph, whose legs, useless,
were doubled under him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here you chaps,” called the doctor, “help
me lift this boy out of here.” Together they
hoisted Ralph out of the cockpit and carried
him into the office where they laid him on a
cot in Hunter’s room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor’s examination required only a
few minutes and he was smiling when he
turned to the others in the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing serious,” he reassured them.
“When he had that crackup this morning he
bruised his legs pretty badly and also strained
his back. The reaction took place this afternoon
and resulted in a temporary paralysis
of the legs. Keep him good and warm for an
hour or two and he’ll be O. K. His legs may
be a little sore and stiff for a day or two but
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The doctor picked up his things and departed.
When he had gone, Ralph looked up
at Tim, his eyes clouded with grief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry I’m such a flop, Tim,” he said.
“I tried hard to make good because you told
Carson I could do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make good?” exclaimed Tim. “Why
Ralph, you’re a flyer if ever there was one.
It takes nerves and brains to do what you
did this afternoon to keep a ship aloft with
your legs paralyzed and your gas supply
dwindling down to nothing. Believe me, that
was flying.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cold winds of winter had been replaced
by the warmer breezes of early spring and
clouds that had been heavy with snow unleashed
their burden of rain. It was poor
weather for flying and Tim, after checking
over his plane, was preparing to leave the
airport.</p>

<p class='c008'>The deep humming of a powerful motor
attracted his attention and he turned toward
the sound. Out of the low gray clouds in the
west a black monoplane flashed into view.
It was coming fast and low. The craft shot
over the field and as it flashed by, Tim noted
that it was a dull black. The fact that there
were no numbers indicating its department
of commerce rating troubled him. Then the
pilot of the unknown plane banked sharply,
and with motor on full, sped back over the
field.</p>

<p class='c008'>An arm flashed over the edge of the fuselage
and a white object floated down. Tim
splashed across the muddy field and retrieved
the letter from the puddle in which it had fallen.
By that time the black plane had disappeared
with only a faint drumming of its
motor to tell of its passing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter held the letter gingerly.
When he turned it over he was astounded to
find that it was addressed to him. On the envelope,
in a rough scrawl, were the words,
“For Tim Murphy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim tore open the envelope and extracted
the single sheet of plain paper. The words
were few but they burned their way into his
mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Murphy,” he read, “you’ve spoiled my
game once. Don’t do it again.” It was signed,
“The Sky Hawk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A queer feeling, certainly not that of fear,
yet hardly that of elation, held Tim for a
moment. So he had crossed the path of the
Sky Hawk, the famous bandit who had been
terrorizing the airways of the east. Tim
smiled a little grimly. So far he had always
been able to take care of himself and he had
won his first tilt with the sky robber.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stories about the Sky Hawk had been
front page news some months before when
he had staged a number of daring aerial holdups
on eastern airways, but recently he had
disappeared, which accounted for the failure
to first connect him with the robbery of the
Transcontinental Air Mail. There were many
tales about the Sky Hawk. Some were that
he was a super-flyer, a famous World war
ace who had gone wrong; others had him
leading a desperate band of aerial gunmen.
One thing Tim knew; if the Sky Hawk had
been piloting the plane which had attacked
the mail, he had a number of accomplices.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter walked over to the
manager’s office and laid the letter on Hunter’s
desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was afraid of something like that,” said
the airport chief when he finished reading
the note. “The possibility of the Sky Hawk
had occurred to me before but I thought I’d
get laughed off the field if I mentioned it.
You’ll take good care of yourself, won’t you,
Tim?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure, Carl, and while I’m here I want to
find out what you know about this flying
circus that blew in a couple of weeks ago.
Why didn’t they stop at your field?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They landed here first but when they
found we charged a percentage on all passengers
carried, they pulled out and rented
a pasture on the other side of town.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess I’ll drift over that way,” said Tim.
“There may be a story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter took the office car he
had used to come down to the field and fifteen
minutes later had skirted the edge of the
city and reached a level tract of land where
several canvas hangars had been erected. A
sign over the gate announced that the “Ace
Company” was ready for business. Tim
turned his car from the main road and into
the field. There was no one on duty at the
gate and he started for one of the hangars
where he could hear men at work.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was about to push aside the canvas flap
when a burly mechanic fairly jumped out of
the tent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What you doing here?” he bawled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just looking around,” replied Tim. “I’m
Murphy of the News?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, so you’re Murphy of the News?”
mimicked the mechanic. “Well, we don’t want
any flying snoopers sticking their noses in
here. Now get out and stay out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim appraised the mechanic. He was six
feet or better and weighed a good two hundred
pounds. To try to argue with him would
be foolhardy and Tim turned and started for
his car.</p>

<p class='c008'>Halfway to the car he paused for a moment,
a peculiar mark on the soft turf of the
field attracting his attention. It was the mark
of a tailskid and from its clean-cut appearance,
must have been made within the last
hour!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c009'>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>On the way back to the office, Tim mulled
over the events of the last few weeks. First
the attack on the transcontinental air mail,
then the warning note from the Sky Hawk,
his gruff reception at the Ace air circus field
and finally his discovery of the tailskid track
on a day that was rotten for flying. Only a
flyer with an urgent mission would think of
flying with the weather conditions what they
were and yet someone had evidently landed
at the Ace field within the last few minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim felt that the gods who hold the threads
of fate were weaving a new pattern and that
he was being drawn deeper and deeper into
it. The flying reporter was seldom blue, but
something in the air, the very grayish color
of the day depressed him and he was moody
when he reached the office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter, Tim?” asked Dan
Watkins, the venerable head of the copy desk.
“You look like you’d lost your last friend.
Suppose you’re mad because all this rainy
weather is keeping you tied down and you
have to associate with us earthworms.” Dan
chuckled at his own sally.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what’s the matter, Dan,”
admitted Tim. “I feel all restless and stirred
up inside—unsettled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The head copy reader looked intently at the
flying reporter and what he saw in the usually
clear blue eyes brought forth his next
words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get your hat, Tim,” he invited, “and come
out and have lunch with me. It will do you
good to get out of this stuffy atmosphere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim welcomed the invitation and Dan
guided him down a side street to a cheery little
restaurant. There was little conversation
until they had given their orders for lunch.</p>

<p class='c008'>On their way to the restaurant Watkins
had carefully appraised Tim, recalled
everything he could remember about the boy,
and had reached a decision. He started the
conversation over the white-topped table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know what’s troubling you, Tim,” he
began. “You’re afraid you’ll get in a rut.
Right?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim nodded, his eyes on fingers which were
fumbling nervously with the silverware.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess that’s about right,” he admitted,
his voice low. “I don’t want to be a flying reporter
all my life and I’m afraid I haven’t
the background to get ahead. But there’s
something more than that.” And Tim told the
copy reader about the note from the Sky
Hawk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t let that worry you, Tim,” advised
the veteran newspaper man. “It may be only
a joke; it may not, but whatever it is, I have
confidence you’ll be able to take care of yourself.
Right now there is something we want
to thresh out. A minute ago you said you
didn’t think you had the background to get
ahead. What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ve only had a high school education
and it takes more than that to get ahead
in the modern newspaper world. I’ve got a
fine job now, piloting the new plane, but in
a few years I won’t be fast enough for that.
Then what? Oh, maybe the weather has made
me blue, but I’ve gotten into an awful
muddle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you have,” agreed the veteran
of the copy desk, “and it looks like it’s high
time for your uncle Dan to straighten things
out for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve seen lots of young chaps go through
this same trouble,” he went on. “Some of them
snapped out of it while others went under.
But listen to me, Tim,” and there was rare
charm and power in the words, “You must
never let this thing get your goat. You’re
made of too fine material.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim started to reply but Dan waved his
words aside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have the opportunity of a lifetime,”
he continued. “Here you are—young, capable,
and with aviation in its swaddling
clothes. Within ten years it will be a giant
among giants and the newspaper man who
knows aviation from the ground up will be in
an enviable position—a position to command
real power and respect.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was new interest in Tim’s eyes and
he drank in Dan Watkins’ words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re luckier than you know,” added the
head copy reader, “for you have behind you a
great newspaper organization. Someday, and
someday soon, the News will need an aviation
editor. Someone who knows the air from
A to Z, someone with nerves and brains and
foresight, and there isn’t a reason in the
world why you shouldn’t fill that editorial
chair when the time comes. Don’t get moody,
don’t get discouraged. I know the weather
gets a fellow’s nerves once in a while but you
must learn to pull yourself over those rough
spots.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you’re right about the future for
an aviation editor,” agreed Tim, “and that’s
one of the things that has put me in the dumps
lately. The field is so big and I know so little
about it. When the time comes to select an
editor I’m afraid Carson will pass me by and
pick a man with more education.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can remedy that, Tim,” said Dan.
“You can take work at night school and I
have a fine library at my room. I’d be only too
glad to lend you some of my books and suggest
reading material that will help you. You’ll
have to hit the line hard, Tim, but you’ve got
the stuff to do it. And besides, Carson likes
you and when he knows you are trying to
better yourself it will make a big difference
with him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim’s face was aglow with new hope and
courage. “I’ll work hard,” he promised. “I
love the flying game; it’s becoming life itself
to me and I want to keep on but I won’t be
satisfied unless I’m something more than a
flying reporter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I admire your ambition, but don’t be too
impatient now, Tim,” counselled the copyreader.
“As a matter of fact you’ve gone a
lot further than most young fellows your
age.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The growth of aviation is going to be
like the growth of the newspapers. The young
fellows who had plenty of foresight back in
1890 and 1900 are the big men of today. I
started in the print shop back in the home
town, sweeping out and sorting lead slugs.
Got fifty cents a week and thought it was
big pay. Next thing, I was setting type by
hand out of a case. Used to sit on a high stool
from 7 o’clock in the morning until night
and the day before we went to press we used
to work half the night.” Dan smiled a little
at the thoughts of the old days.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When we first read about Mergenthaler
and his typesetting machine, we thought he
was a nut of some kind. But a few believed in
him and today they are the leaders in the
newspaper business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We used to print our weekly paper on a
Washington hand press, and it took us all
day to get out a few hundred copies. Now
even the weeklies have modern presses while
the dailies turn out 36, 48 and 56 page papers
by the thousands every hour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The same revolution has taken place in
the editorial rooms. When I first came to
work on the News we had one dinky little
telegraph wire that brought only a few hundred
words of news a day. We’d take that
and pad it out and also used the scissors liberally
to cut dispatches out of the big eastern
papers. We never knew from one week to
another whether our pay checks were good
and it was always a race to see who could get
to the bank first.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dan paused for a moment, then he continued,
“But look at the office today. A dozen
reporters, an editor to handle every department,
half a dozen telegraph wires that bring
the news from every corner of the world and
even an airplane to ferret out the stories in
the clouds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim smiled at the last phrase.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The aviation game is like a newspaper,”
went on the copyreader. “The newspaper
went through its baby days and has emerged
into one of the greatest institutions of our
modern times. So it will be with aviation. I
scoffed at the first strides of modern
journalism, and look where I am.” There was no
note of self-pity in the words, simply a plain
statement of fact, and Dan hurried on before
Tim could speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m only a copyreader while if I had been
alert to realize the possibilities way back in
the nineties, I might have been the head of
this paper or some other like it. I don’t want
you to miss your chance Tim. You’re alert
and eager now; keep on that way and I’ll help
you all I can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim left the office that afternoon
the rain was still falling steadily but he did
not feel depressed. He was fired with new
enthusiasm and determination. Far into the
night he mulled over Dan Watkins’ words and
he knew that the older man’s advice was
sound and true. It was a goal Tim had hardly
dared dream to attain and one that at times
had made his heart ache at the futility of his
dreams. But the kindly counsel of the older
man had set his mind into new channels of
thought and given him the impetus he needed.
It was a long, hard road to follow but before
he went to sleep, Tim had determined to
throw his every energy toward attainment
of his goal.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim reached the office the next
morning he found Ralph Parsons waiting
for him, a camera on his desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurry up, Tim,” called his chum. “Carson
just phoned down and ordered us out on
an assignment. They say that the Cedar River
is flooding the entire country over east.
Worst high water in twenty-five years, and
he wants some good pictures for this afternoon’s
editions. We’ll have to hustle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>While Ralph was talking, Tim telephoned
to the airport and ordered the Lark serviced
and put on the line ready to go. It was raining
hard but the weather bulletin indicated clearing
weather by mid-forenoon so they would
have a chance to get some good pictures when
they reached the valley.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim and Ralph skidded through the city in
one of the News’ cars and when they reached
the airport found the Lark ready for them,
its motor turning over slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter came out of his office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a bad morning for a takeoff,” he
warned Tim. “What in thunder is bringing
you out on a day like this?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got a report of a big flood in the
Cedar River valley,” said Tim, “and Ralph’s
going to try for some pictures if the rain
clears up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter grunted, then said, “Better keep
over to the north side of the field, Tim, and
get her off as quick as you can. The other
end of this flat is under a good foot of water
and it’s all pretty much of a swamp.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim and Ralph waved at the manager of
the field, Tim gave the Lark full throttle,
and they sloshed over the field and got away
to a sluggish takeoff. The muck and water
sucked at the Lark’s wheels and it was with
an effort that Tim got his craft into the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once clear of the field, he headed into the
east. The ceiling was low that morning; not
over 500 feet, and the Lark thundered over
farms and small towns at better than 100
miles an hour. Tim piloted wholly by compass
but after forty-five minutes of flying they
ran out of the rain and the sky began to clear.
When they sighted the Cedar River valley
the sun was out from behind the clouds for
the first time in days.</p>

<p class='c008'>A scene of majestic destruction unfolded
itself as Tim swung the Lark over the valley
of the Cedar. The usually peaceful stream
was on a mighty rampage, its banks hidden
by swirling torrents of dirty, yellow water
which spread for more than a mile in either
direction. In the heart of the foaming flood
could be seen great trees, torn up by their
roots, and farm buildings that bobbled and
turned as if in protest. Over all there was
an air of utter desolation, the surrender of
man to the wrath of the elements.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was fascinated by the terrible splendor
of the scene, and he banked the Lark
gracefully as Ralph took picture after picture
of the great flood. To the south Tim
sighted a cluster of buildings marooned in
the center of the raging stream. He turned
the plane and sped toward them. In another
minute he recognized the village of Auburn,
the scene of his first exploit as a flying reporter.
The once peaceful hamlet, which, he
remembered, had been on the right bank of
the Cedar, was surrounded by the rampant
waters. While Tim circled the village, Ralph
managed to secure two graphic pictures of
the marooned village.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim could see a little group gathered in
front of the general store and once he thought
they were gesturing to him, but he dared not
go closer. Motor trouble at any lower altitude
would mean a plunge into the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few minutes before noon Tim dropped
the crimson-winged Lark down out of the
clouds and skidded over the muddy field. He
uncurled his legs and got stiffly out of the
cockpit. Ralph hopped down beside him, his
camera under his arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>They left orders for mechanics at the field
to take care of the plane and then headed
toward the city in the car they had left at the
field.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s some flood,” said Ralph as they
sped toward the office. “I didn’t think there
was so much water in the whole world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was preoccupied and his words were
slow in coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m wondering how things are at Auburn,”
said he. “With communication cut off,
they might be in bad shape. Wish we could
have gone lower but I didn’t dare, and we
had to get your plates back as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When they entered the editorial office, the
managing editor was waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get ’em?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet,” said Ralph, “some dandies,”
and he laid his camera with its graphic record
of the flood, on the managing editor’s desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carson hurriedly made out a rush order
for the engraving room and sent a copy boy
scurrying away with the camera. In less than
an hour they would appear on the front page
of the noonday extra, a real scoop over every
other paper in town.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim and Ralph went out for lunch,
the sky was overcast again with hurrying
rain clouds and the city was shrouded in a
pall of low-lying clouds and heavy smoke.
They were gone not more than half an hour
but when they returned Carson beckoned at
them, one ear glued to a telephone receiver.
He was writing rapidly, occasionally asking
a tense question. When he had finished he
turned to Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is bad, Tim,” said the managing
editor. “That little town of Auburn that you
flew over this morning had been isolated for
four days now. They’re getting low on food
and typhoid has broken out in the village.
There isn’t a boat left in the village and even
if trucks could get near there with boats,
the river is so churned up they wouldn’t be
able to get out to the village. I’ve just talked
to the owner of the general store at Auburn.
He’d taken to a barn door and trusted to
luck that the current would take him ashore.
He got through safely and called us from
Applington. They’re appealing to us to do
something.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get me the food and serum they need
and I’ll drop it to them in less than two
hours,” replied Tim rising to the challenge
in the managing editor’s eyes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c009'>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Tim’s instant response to the appeal from
the flood-stricken village pleased the managing
editor immensely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fine, Tim, fine,” said Carson. “This will
be great stuff. Good advertising for the News
and at the same time a real bit of service.
I’ll call the Red Cross and have everything
ready. How much can you carry?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“About five hundred pounds,” said the
flying reporter. “Have them put it in two
strong sacks, big ones, and get it to the field
in half an hour. I’ll hustle out there and
get a parachute ready.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where do I come in?” expostulated Ralph,
who had no intention of being left out of the
party. “If you’re going to take five hundred
pounds of food and medical supplies, there
won’t be room for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know it, Ralph, and I’m sorry,” replied
Tim. “But right now the food and medicine
mean more to those villagers than your presence
circling around in the clouds above
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim’s words were without sarcasm and
Ralph grinned in spite of his disappointment,
but he knew that Tim was right.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll go out to the field with you,” he volunteered,
“and I may be able to help you fix
the parachute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You could help a lot,” agreed Tim, and
they hurried out of the office on their way to
the airport.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they reached the field, Tim enlisted
the aid of Hunter and they opened up a parachute
pack. Springs were carefully inserted
and so arranged that they would force the
big silken umbrella open three seconds after
it had been dropped from the plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were just completing their work with
the parachute when a truck from the Red
Cross office arrived with the supplies, packed
in two strong canvas sacks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The serum’s in the center of one of the
bags,” said the truck driver, “and they said
you wouldn’t need to worry about breaking
the glass tubes. They’ve packed everything
carefully.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim soon rigged the sacks on the side of
the Lark with the parachute attached to
them. A single hard jerk on the rope which
held the sacks would send them tumbling
earthward to the stricken village.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter checked his plane with
even greater care than usual. He couldn’t afford
to take a risk, too much depended on the
outcome of his flight. Finally, satisfied that
all was well, he climbed into the rear cockpit
and settled his long legs on the rudder bar.
The motor was purring musically.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph climbed up on the fuselage and bent
close to Tim, “Good luck,” he shouted, and
slapped his chum on the back.</p>

<p class='c008'>That was characteristic of the generousness
of Ralph’s nature and Tim warmed inwardly
for he knew how keenly Ralph wanted
to make the trip with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a roar of the motor and a flirt of its
tail, Tim sent the Lark rocketing into the
eastern sky on its errand of mercy while the
great presses in the News building uptown
were even then grinding out the story of his
daring attempt.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a little less than an hour of flying,
he sighted the swirling, dirty-yellow current
of the Cedar and swung down the valley to
pick up the marooned village, a cluster of
houses in the midst of a great expanse of
angry flood waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>The roar of the Lark’s motor attracted the
attention of the villagers and they gathered
in the town square to watch the circling plane.
Tim swept low and pointed to the sacks on the
side of his plane. The expressions on the upturned
faces of the people indicated that they
understood what he was going to attempt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim banked sharply and headed upstream.
The clouds had broken somewhat but there
were indications of an almost momentary
squall. He would have to hurry to accomplish
his mission. The winds were hard out of the
east and it would take careful calculations of
speed and wind drift to land his cargo on
the tiny island.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he was a mile upstream from the
village, Tim turned and headed down stream,
ready for the attempt. He cut the speed of
the Lark as low as he dared and waited until
he judged the right moment was at hand. Then
he jerked the rope that held his precious cargo
to the side of the plane. He saw the sacks drop
away and watched the parachute spring open
and billow out in the breeze.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment Tim watched the parachute
falling straight and true. The wind was a
trifle stronger than he had anticipated but it
looked as if the sacks would land near the far
end of the island.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sudden squall swept over the valley and
rain blotted out the scene below. It was over
in thirty seconds but when Tim sighted the
parachute again it was settling into the churning
waters at the south end of the island. The
villagers desperately cast long poles with
hooked ends into the stream in an effort to
snare the parachute and pull it to shore, but
in less than a minute the silken umbrella, with
its two sacks of serum and food, were sucked
down by the hungry Cedar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was heart-sick when he turned the
Lark up-stream, nosed down, and sped over
the village again. He leaned over the side of
the cockpit and tried, with gestures, to tell
the disappointed group that he would return
to Atkinson, secure more supplies, and make
another attempt. But in his heart he doubted
if the second trip would be any more successful
than the first. The clouds were heavier and
the winds had increased to almost gale
strength. Riding on the wings of the easterly
wind, he swept down on the Atkinson airport
just forty minutes after his unsuccessful attempt
to relieve the suffering at Auburn.</p>

<p class='c008'>While his plane splashed over the muddy
field and slithered to a stop in front of the
office, Tim evolved a plan which might mean
the salvation of the villagers. Desperate it
was, and its chances of success would be slim,
but it was worth trying if he could convince
his managing editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carson was at the field waiting for news of
the flight. At his side was Ralph Parsons, a
camera in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a minute, Tim,” yelled the managing
editor, as the young flyer started to climb
down from him mud-bespattered plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pose in your ship while we get some pictures
of the ‘Hero of the Air.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim shook his head. “Not now Mr. Carson,
I’m anything but a hero. I failed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What,” exclaimed the managing editor,
for failure was something that so far had not
entered into the life of the flying reporter.
“Why what do you mean, Tim?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The sacks landed in the river,” explained
Tim. “I had them aimed all right but a little
squall swept over the valley after I released
them and carried them too far.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carson was silent and his disappointment
was evident. Then Tim went on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Mr. Carson, if ever any group of
people needs help, that little town of Auburn
does. I went down so close I could see their
faces; they’re desperate. Give me another
chance and I’ll make good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There isn’t time today,” said the managing
editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes there is, if we work fast.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t the same thing happen again?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No!” There was ringing conviction in
Tim’s words. “I’ll get the stuff there or bust
in the attempt. Besides, I’ve got a new plan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Carson looked at his flying reporter for a
moment. The light in Tim’s blue eyes and the
determined lines around his mouth convinced
the managing editor that he could back up his
words with success.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” he agreed, “shoot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For a minute Tim and the managing editor,
with Ralph listening in, talked earnestly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you’re crazy,” exclaimed Carson,
“But it’s worth a try. It’s your neck; not mine
that you’re risking.” With that the managing
editor hurried to his car and sped toward the
city to fulfill his part of the preparations.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think you can do it?” Ralph anxiously
wanted to know as they hurried toward
the main office of the airport.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There isn’t any ‘think’ about it, Ralph,”
replied Tim. “I’ve got to. This is going to
cost the News some good, hard cash and if I
fall down on this job I won’t need to come
back. And you know what that would mean
to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph was silent, weighing his chum’s
chances for success, and they talked no more
until they reached the office and entered the
manager’s room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter looked up from his desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No such luck, Carl,” said Tim. “The wind
blew it into the river.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, that’s too bad,” said the field manager.
“I guess those folks over in the valley
are in bad shape, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They need help,” agreed Tim, “and I’m
going to make another try right away. Is that
old Jenny over in hangar No. 3 capable of
staggering into the air?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean the sister to the ship Ralph
cracked up a few weeks ago?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It might get off the ground but I wouldn’t
guarantee it would stay in the air. What do
you want with that old crate?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never mind that, Carl. How much do you
want for it if we can get the motor to turn
over fast enough to get into the air?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter whistled and scratched his ear reflectively.
“About $200 the way she is, but I
won’t promise a thing. You’ll have to take
your chances.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sold!” said Tim, “Carson said I could buy
that war relic providing you didn’t try to
hold me up. He’ll O.K. the bill when he comes
back. Let’s get going.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With Ralph and Hunter at his heels, he
hurried toward hangar No. 3. There, in one
corner of the big structure, was a venerable
Jenny, a sister ship to the one Ralph had
smashed on his first solo hop. Orders flew
from Tim and Hunter and in less than fifteen
minutes a crew of mechanics had gone over
the old plane, filled its motor with gas and oil,
and had it warming up in front of the hangar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got any old canvas around?” Tim asked
Hunter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s some in No. 2 hangar. How much
do you need?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just enough to cover the bottom of the
fuselage of this ancient sky bird and make
it water proof,” said Tim. Hunter hustled out
to find the heavy fabric while Ralph hurried
away in quest of a pot of shellac.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the time the managing editor returned
from the city with a new supply of serum and
food, the Jenny was a queer looking bird. The
bottom of the fuselage had been covered with
heavy canvas and doused liberally with quick
drying shellac to make it water-tight. The
decrepit wings showed where new patches had
been hurriedly slapped on and mechanics had
completed emergency wiring of the wings to
insure them from collapsing and sending Tim
spinning down from the clouds with his plane
out of control.</p>

<p class='c008'>The new sacks of supplies were dumped
into the forward cockpit. Tim swung into
the rear pit, ran the throttle back and forth
and listened to the song of the motor. Its
r.p.m.’s were a little slow but it was firing
steady and true. He waggled the controls to
be sure that everything responded and then
slipped his goggles down over his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t take too many chances,” the managing
editor yelled as he revved up the motor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim waved his hand, and then pushed the
throttle on full. The old skybird quivered and
gathered herself for the takeoff. The wings
creaked and groaned but the motor responded
to its task and Tim finally lifted the old crate
off the ground and soared into the east for
the third time that day.</p>

<p class='c008'>He glanced at his wrist watch. It was
nearly 5 o’clock and that meant only a little
more than an hour of light left in which to
accomplish his task. With 100 miles to the
valley and against the wind all the way, it
required nearly an hour and a half for the old
ship couldn’t turn a mile over eighty an hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim settled down to do some straight and
careful flying. He nursed the old crate along
for all it was worth and the “Hisso” hammered
until he thought it would throw connecting
rods all over the countryside.</p>

<p class='c008'>For nearly an hour Tim dodged rain
squalls. Then, realizing that he was getting
down into the river territory, he brought the
old crate closer to the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he sped along above the broken landscape,
Tim craned from the cockpit, watching
the ground below with eyes that smarted in
the sharp backwash of the propeller.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he found a large field, fenced in with
heavy posts, he banked sharply and dropped
his plane closer to the ground. Now he was
roaring along not more than ten feet above
the soggy, waterlogged field. It was anything
but an inviting spot for a forced landing. As
a matter of fact Tim knew he wouldn’t have a
chance for any kind of a landing if his motor
cut out on him then.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ahead of him loomed the edge of the field
with its fence. He picked out one post, which
reared its head higher than the others. The
flying reporter, like Don Quixote of old who
had sent his horse galloping into a windmill,
headed his craft for the sturdy timber.</p>

<p class='c008'>The big test was at hand. It would require
all the skill in Tim’s hands and all his nerve to
accomplish it successfully. A false move and
the Jenny would be a heap on the ground, his
chance of relieving the situation at Auburn
gone for he had staked everything, even his
job, on this attempt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just before the propeller ripped into the
post Tim pulled back hard on the stick. The
Jenny answered sluggishly and his heart
skipped a beat. The plane staggered in midair
and Tim heard the sound of rending wood.
Then the old craft lunged on and upward,
shaking herself like an injured bird. Tim
looked back to see his landing gear draped
over the post.</p>

<p class='c008'>He could hardly repress a shout as he
headed the old crate for the valley again. In
the air, the Jenny looked like a flying washboard
but Tim had accomplished one part of
his task. He had converted his craft into a
seaplane of sorts. True it was that in design
and balance it violated every rule of aeronautics,
but it flew and that was the big thing.
Now to land safely on the river.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim reached the valley the rain was
falling in torrents and the clouds seemed to
be crushing him to earth. The light was nearly
gone and he would have to work fast.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old crate was vibrating more than ever.
The crash into the post must have loosened
something in the vitals of the Jenny for it was
obviously near the end of its long career. If
it would only hold together a few more minutes
it would wind up its life in a smashing
climax.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tired old “Hisso” sputtered, then
caught again and fired steadily. But Tim
knew the signs. The rain was finding its way
through the cowling and down onto the motor.
It would be only a matter of minutes before
the motor would cut out. Now it was a race
between the coming night, a weakening motor
and the flood-maddened Cedar. The odds were
great but Tim faced them coolly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He roared over the village and swept upstream.
Then he turned and came down low
over the river. A quarter of a mile above the
upper end of the island he was barely skimming
the surface of the river. He cut the
motor, there was plenty of speed left.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Tim set his flying scow down on the
water. He struck with a crash, bounced,
struck again, and splashed along on top of
the foaming water. He was going fast, too
fast for comfort, but there was nothing he
could do. The island loomed ahead. Tim shut
his eyes and ducked behind the cockpit. There
was a sickening lurch, then a jarring thud
that shook the whole plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anxious hands pulled Tim out of the cockpit
while others seized the sacks of food and
medical supplies. A tree stump had broken
the speed of the plane but it had struck the
bank hard enough to smash the propeller to
bits and bury the nose of the engine in the dirt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later in the evening, after the village
doctor had made good use of the typhoid
serum and the food had been rationed out,
Tim made his way back to the scene of his
landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hungry Cedar had been tugging at the
wrecked plane and, as Tim reached the river’s
edge, it swung the craft away from the bank
and out into the current. The old crate was
gone but it had had a glorious finish. He
would have a great story to send to the News
as soon as boats were able to reach the village.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c009'>CHAPTER SIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Several days after his flight with supplies to
the marooned village in the Cedar river valley,
Tim had an unexpected visitor. He looked
up from his work to find a tall, curly haired
man of not more than thirty years of age,
standing beside his desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you Tim Murphy?” inquired the visitor.
Tim nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m Kurt Blandin, boss of the Ace flying
circus,” replied the other. “I hear one of the
boys treated you rather roughly the other
day and I thought I’d drop in and invite you
to come and see us again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim thought he noted a peculiar, strained
quality in the other’s voice, and he deliberated
his answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll run out some day,” he said. “As a matter
of fact I couldn’t see any reason why I
was given the cold shoulder when I was out
the first time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blandin laughed and Tim found himself
rather liking the other when he smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“An air circus,” he said, “is bound to have
some accidents and sometimes we aren’t
treated any too well in the newspapers. So
you can’t blame the mechanic for giving you
the bum’s rush. But everything will be O. K.
the next time you call.” With that Blandin
breezed out of the office and Tim stared after
him blankly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Somewhere he had seen the face before.
There were familiar lines about the mouth,
a peculiar little scar over the right eye and
a hardness of the voice that once heard would
never be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c008'>He forced his thoughts back to his work
but Blandin and the Ace air circus troubled
him. What were they doing at Atkinson?
Could there be any connection between them
and the Sky Hawk?</p>

<p class='c008'>The ghostly quiet that comes just before
the dawn was broken by the insistent voice of
the telephone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim rubbed the sleep from his eyes and
grabbed savagely at the offending instrument.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, hello!” he barked.</p>

<p class='c008'>An anxious voice came over the wire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What!” Tim’s exclamation was charged
with alarm. “You’re sure? All right, I’ll be
at the field just as soon as I can throw on some
clothes and get in touch with Ralph.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim jammed the receiver on its hook, only
to seize it a moment later and something in
his voice made the operator buzz furiously
as she rang Ralph’s number. After an interval
that seemed an age to Tim, a sleepy voice answered
the operator’s imperative rings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That you, Ralph?” cried Tim. When the
voice admitted that it belonged to Ralph, Tim
poured his story over the wire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wake up, Ralph. Wake up,” he urged.
“There’s plenty of trouble over in the Big
Smokies. Bad Storm last night and the west-bound
Transcontinental plane has crashed
somewhere. They haven’t had a trace of it
since the ship went over Newton. The Transcontinental
people have sent out a general
alarm and Hunter just phoned and asked us
to help in the search. Meet me at the field just
as soon as you can get there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph, thoroughly awakened by Tim’s
words, promised to be at the field in fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter completed dressing and
hastened from his room in quest of a taxicab.
A driver, on the lookout for early morning
fares, was loafing down the street and
Tim hailed the cab.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To the municipal field,” he ordered when
the cab pulled up at the curb, “and step on the
gas. This is important.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The gears crashed together and the cab
lurched away into the night, gathering speed
as it headed down the almost deserted avenues.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they reached the field they found it
ablaze with light. Pilots and mechanics were
hurrying in and out of the hangars and planes
were being warmed up and pushed on the
line.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Charge it to the News,” said Tim as he
disembarked. Hunter, who came running out
of the office, greeted him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glad to see you, Tim,” he said. “We’re
getting things lined up to start as soon as
it gets light. I’ve put a crew to servicing your
plane and she’ll be ready in a few minutes.
Where’s Ralph? Isn’t he going?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter’s question was answered by another
snorting taxi, and Ralph, only half awake,
tumbled from the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s all the excitement and the big
rush to get away so quick?” demanded Tim.
“The air mail has cracked up before and has
always come out on top.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Plenty of reason for the rush this time,”
said Hunter. “The plane last night was carrying
something like $500,000 in securities
from New York for a Los Angeles bank.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim whistled. “No wonder they’re getting
everything out that can flap its wings. We’ll
be with the rest of them, Carl, and glad of
the chance to go. It will make a dandy story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim did not voice his real thoughts for
there was no need to unduly alarm the field
manager, but the minute the $500,000 had
been mentioned, the thought of the Sky Hawk
flashed through his mind. It was about time
for that daring bandit of the skyways to
swoop down in some bold manoeuvre. The
storm might have been responsible for the
failure of the mail to reach its destination
and, again, it might not.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Called you right away,” added the field
manager, “for I knew you’d want the story.
But on top of that, I wanted you to make the
trip. I figure you’re one of the best pilots
around here to go out on a mission like this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim grinned and gave Hunter a good-natured
shove. The driver of Ralph’s taxi
was turning his cab around and preparing to
start back for the city when Tim’s cry
stopped him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait a few minutes,” he ordered, “and
I’ll have you take a story to the News office.”
The driver agreed and shut off the motor of
his cab.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Check up on the plane, Ralph,” said Tim,
“and see that we have plenty of equipment for
an emergency landing in the mountains—light,
stout cable, an axe, some food and
water and a first aid kit. While you’re doing
that I’ll go into Hunter’s room and write a
story to send to the office.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In less than fifteen minutes Tim had hammered
out a column story that fairly glittered
with the sharpness of its sentences and the
clearness of his simple, powerful English.</p>

<p class='c008'>The air mail was lost somewhere in the
Great Smokies, and the flying reporter, in the
Lark, would soon be away on the search. Tim
smiled to himself as he thought how Carson
could play up the story. Now if they could only
find the missing plane, it would be one of the
best stories of the year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim hurried out of the office and handed his
story to the waiting taxi driver. That done,
he turned toward the line where five planes
were being warmed up for the search.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter walked over to the
airmen who were grouped around the field manager.
He greeted Sparks, Bronson, White and
Wilkins, all mail and express pilots—fine fellows
every one of them; lean bronzed and alive
to the zest of flying. But now there were more
serious lines to their faces and it was a determined
group of young men who heard Hunter
outline the plans for the search. Ralph hastened
up and joined them just as the field chief
gave his final instructions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Buddy Perkins, who was on the mail, went
over Newton on time,” said Hunter, “and he
must have run into the storm about half an
hour later. That would put him almost up to
the divide but with the wind against him all
the way, he probably didn’t make Billy Goat.
I’ve marked out a map with the section each
one of you is to cover. When you run short of
fuel about noon, drop down to Newton, refuel,
eat and exchange notes. I hope you won’t
have to go on out again, hope you’ll locate Perkins
by noon. It’s light enough to takeoff now,
fellows, so get going and good luck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim and Ralph took their places in the Good
News, which was the third ship on the line.
It was just light enough to distinguish the
fence which marked the far end of the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sparks and Bronson roared away, flame
shooting from the exhausts of their motors.
Then Tim shoved his throttle ahead and sent
the Lark skimming into the air. Behind him
came White and Wilkins. Away into the west
they sped, traveling on the wings of the dawn,
intent on their quest for the missing Perkins.</p>

<p class='c008'>Within the hour they had roared over Newton,
nestled in the foothills of the Great
Smokies, and had started clawing for altitude.
The Lark handled beautifully in the cool air of
the early September morning and answered
to Tim’s every movement.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter could see Sparks and
Bronson swing away to his left while White
and Wilkins turned to the right to cover the
territory which Hunter had mapped out for
each plane. Tim was more fortunate than the
other flyers for he had Ralph’s keen eyes to
help him comb the uneven ground below.
Ahead of them loomed the Billy Goat, the
highest peak of the range. Tim’s sector was
on the east slope of the lofty mountain. Up
and down, back and forth, Tim swung the
Lark as he shuttled along the path usually followed
by the air mail and express planes. The
Billy Goat glistened in the morning sun but
smiled grimly—almost defiantly Tim imagined,
as it thwarted his every effort to find
any trace of the missing plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>By mid-forenoon Tim’s gas supply was getting
low and he signalled to Ralph that he was
going to turn back to Newton and replenish
his fuel. They were near the top of Billy
Goat and both Tim and Ralph felt certain
that if Perkins had crashed on that side of
the mountain they would have sighted him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim cut his motor and let the Lark soar
gracefully downward from the summit of the
range. For a moment he forgot the urgent
mission which had brought them out and reveled
in the sheer joy of flying. Like a great
bird his plane wheeled and swooped in the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>Half way to Newton Tim was joined by
Sparks and White. They landed at the emergency
field at the foothill town and a few
minutes later were joined by Bronson and
Wilkins. There was no need to ask about their
success. Their faces told the story of the failure
of their efforts.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the other pilots were refueling their
planes, Tim hurried into the village where he
secured a basket of sandwiches. He made
several inquiries in the village and related the
result of these when he returned to the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>The airmen sprawled beneath their planes
and hastily munched the sandwiches Tim had
provided.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You say he went through here on time?”
asked White, who had been a close friend of
the missing Perkins.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what they say in Newton,” replied
Tim. “The storm was threatening when
Perk went over and he was flying pretty low
and fast. About half an hour after he passed,
the storm swept down from Billy Goat and
from what folks here say, it was a bad one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Half an hour,” grunted Ralph between
bites of a sandwich. “That means he was
pretty well up toward the divide. Maybe he
got across on the other side.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s just too bad if he did,” remarked
Bronson. “You know what the other side of
the Billy Goat is like. Not a nickel’s worth of
room for a forced landing. If Perk got on
the other side he’s crashed sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Might not be that bad,” said Tim. “Anyway,
I’m going to try the other side of Billy
Goat this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out you don’t disappear along with
Perk,” warned White.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not much chance of that with Ralph
along,” grinned Tim. “I’ll see you fellows
here later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The foothills awoke to the roar of five high-powered
airplane motors and one after
another the flyers took off to resume their
hunt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim gunned the Lark and headed straight
for the crest of the Great Smokies. The divide
was a little to the right of Billy Goat.
Tim boosted his plane over the snow-capped
tops of the range and coasted down the other
side. The slope on the west side was more
broken—deep canyons with good-sized
streams plunging along in their depths. But
from the plane the rivers looked like ribbons
of silver. It was a scene of majestic beauty
but it gave Tim the shivers when he thought
of being trapped on the inhospitable slope
in a storm or, worse, at the mercy of the Sky
Hawk.</p>

<p class='c008'>For fifty miles Tim and Ralph followed the
path of the mail and express ships, searching
every valley, but their efforts were fruitless.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim frowned bitterly and turned the Lark
eastward in a tight bank. Ralph looked back
apprehensively but Tim only shook his head
and pointed southeast. How blind he had been.
If Perkins had made the crest of the divide
and gotten over before the storm caught him,
he would probably have been driven southwest
along the side of the mountains. The
Great Smokies ran northeast and southwest
and the storm of the night before had swept
down almost directly from the north.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim again reached the western slope
of the Billy Goat, he headed south and west.
He scribbled a note to Ralph, explaining his
reason for the sudden about face, and his
companion nodded approval.</p>

<p class='c008'>For an hour they searched the side of the
range south of Billy Goat, and Tim, with an
eye on the gas gauge, was about to give up
the quest, when Ralph shouted and pointed
downward.</p>

<p class='c008'>A flash of white on a rocky ledge caught
Tim’s eye and he circled lower. His breath
caught sharply. Ralph’s sharp eyes had found
the wreck of the air express. On a ledge of
rock cropping out from the side of the mountain
they could see the twisted remains of the
plane!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c009'>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Tim stalled down over the wreck of the air
mail. There was no sign of life; no sign of
Perk. His heart caught in his throat. Perk
had been a mighty good flyer and a good fellow.
Tim bad known him only casually but
he had been well liked by all the other pilots
in the air service. There was a chance that the
airman, unharmed in the crackup, might have
started to make his way out of the wilderness
of broken rock and tangled forest on foot.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim made a careful survey of the shelf
that jutted out from the mountain side. It was
not more than 100 feet wide and perhaps
400 feet long—a dangerous place on which
to attempt a landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter shut off his motor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you say?” he shouted at Ralph,
and pointed to the ledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go on,” came the reply. “You’ll make it
all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim tore off his goggles and Ralph did likewise.
No use endangering their eyes if they
crashed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter put the Lark into a
sideslip. Just before they slid into the side of
the mountain he leveled off and set the plane
down almost on the edge of the rocky shelf.
The ship bounded forward and he shoved the
brakes on hard. They were still going fast,
too fast. In a few more seconds they would
pile up on the rocks ahead. Tim jammed his
left wheel brake on hard and released the right
one. The plane staggered, dug its left wing
into the ground and almost did a ground loop.
But the maneuver killed the speed and Ralph
and Tim leaped from their plane and ran toward
the wreck of the air mail.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the looks of things, Perkins, blinded
by the storm and driven far off his course,
had rammed straight into the side of the
mountain. The nose of the big biplane, with
the motor, had been bashed back into the express
cockpit and the landing gear had folded
up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim fairly leaped up the side of the fuselage
and into the pilot’s cockpit, but Perkins
was nowhere in sight. On the padded leather
seat Tim found a folded sheet of paper. With
eager fingers he grasped it and read its message
at a glance.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Tim,” he read. “The first time we
met you won; this time fate brought the mail
into my hands and right now I’m richer by
some $500,000, which will keep me out of
mischief for some time. I just happened to
be crossing the Great Smokies this morning
and saw the mail, which had cracked up in
the storm last night. Don’t you wish you had
a helicopter on your plane to lift you off this
ledge? But I don’t think the pilot is badly
hurt. See you later, and remember, the score
is even.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no need for Tim to read the name
signed to the note. The Sky Hawk, profiting
by the vagaries of the storm, had struck
again!</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph, who had gone around to the far side
of the plane, cried out. When Tim reached his
chum he found him under one wing, bending
over the unconscious form of the mail pilot.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a jagged cut on one side of
Perkins’ head where he must have come in
contact with some part of the plane in the
crackup. His face was a grayish-white and
Tim instantly realized that he was in need of
expert medical attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How badly do you think he’s hurt?” asked
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” replied Tim. “He’s got a
nasty crack on the head and it may be serious
and it may not. Get me the first aid kit in our
ship and I’ll dress this wound on his head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In less than five minutes Tim had dressed
the cut and with Ralph’s assistance, had
carried Perkins into the sunlight where his
clothes, still damp from the rain of the night
before, would have a chance to dry. He was
breathing slowly but regularly and they
forced a little water between his lips. While
they were working over Perk, Tim showed the
Sky Hawk’s note to Ralph, and their lips were
drawn in hard, straight lines as they realized
the power of the unknown bandit of the skyways.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both Tim and Ralph knew that their real
task, that of making a successful takeoff from
the narrow ledge, was their biggest problem
and they turned to it with determination. With
Perkins taken care of temporarily, they made
sure that the remaining registered mail was
O. K. and then transferred it to their own
plane. After that they started their survey of
the shelf on which they had landed. On one
side was the mountain, on the other a drop of
nearly 1,000 feet. The surface of the shelf
was fairly even but it was only about 400 feet
long, far too short for a takeoff, especially
with three in the Lark as there would be on
the return trip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks like we’re going to be marooned
here along with Perk,” said Ralph dubiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t quite as bad as all that,” replied
Tim. “If you’re willing to take a long chance,
I think we can make it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve seen those pictures of how the
navy uses a catapult to launch its fighting
planes from the decks of battleships?” Ralph
nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll use the same principle. Shoot ourselves
into the air.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we haven’t any catapult and the nearest
battleship is a thousand miles away,” said
Ralph, still unconvinced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” said Tim. “I’ll show you how
it can be done. Give me a hand now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Under Tim’s directions, they managed to
trundle the Lark to the end of the ledge where
the air mail had crashed. There they turned
it around and pointed its nose toward the
far end of the shelf.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What now?” demanded Ralph.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Open up that bundle of light cable we
brought and get out the axe,” said Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>When that had been completed he took the
cable and tied one end securely around a huge
boulder directly back of the tail assembly of
the Lark. The other end he passed along the
fuselage and lashed around the nose of the
ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simple, isn’t it?” asked Tim when he had
made sure that the ends of the cable had been
properly secured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simple, yes,” agreed Ralph. “But what
does it spell?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“C-a-t-a-p-u-l-t,” said Tim. “C-a-t-a-p-u-l-t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I heard you the first time, but that doesn’t
look like a catapult to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it is,” insisted Tim. “And if you’ll
stop asking questions and help me boost
Perkins into your cockpit, we’ll get out of
here. It’s getting late now and will be dark
by the time we get to Atkinson.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Together they managed to get the inert
form of Perkins into the forward cockpit and
made him as comfortable as possible. Tim
primed the starter and the motor caught on
the first turn over.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph was looking skeptically at Tim’s
make-shift catapult.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When I give her full throttle you slash the
rope with the axe,” explained Tim. “I’ll admit
that isn’t much of a catapult but it will give us
a lot of added momentum when you use the
axe.” Ralph, only half convinced, hopped into
his cockpit and leaned over the side, axe in
hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim tested the sturdy motor thoroughly. If
it failed him when he started on his mad takeoff,
they would plunge 1,000 feet down the
side of the mountain to be impaled on the
tall pines far below.</p>

<p class='c008'>Satisfied that the motor would do its share,
Tim settled himself for the test. He glanced
ahead. The edge of the shelf looked dangerously
near but there was no other course to
take. He must get Perkins where he could
have the best of medical attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim opened his throttle. Faster and faster
he threw the raw gas into the motor until the
plane quivered like a thing alive. The engine
was thrumming wildly and Tim threw up his
left hand, the signal for Ralph to cut the cable.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a well-aimed blow, Ralph’s axe bit
through the rope and the Lark leaped
forward like an arrow and flashed toward the
edge of the precipice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plane bounced from side to side on the
uneven ground and Tim held his breath as
they swooped nearer the end of their short
runway. But the plane was gaining speed
rapidly. How rapidly, he didn’t dare look.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the last moment Tim pulled back hard
on the stick but it was as though some giant
had tied a string to the Lark and was playing
with them. The plane staggered into the air,
settled back, bounced hard, and then shot skyward.
They were off at last but hovering
dizzily in the air. The motor labored at its
task and Tim sensed a losing battle. The
added weight of Perkins in the front cockpit
might be just enough to turn the scales
against them. In another second they would
be in a spin, hurtling down to death on the
gaunt pines.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a flash Tim took his only chance and
threw the Lark into a power dive. That would
give him the momentum necessary to handle
his craft. Down the side of the mountain
roared the plane, the wild beating of its motor
echoing and re-echoing among the cliffs and
valleys. They were almost on the tree tops
when Tim pulled the nose of his ship up and
leveled off with his plane under control.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim set his course for the crest of the
range and was just sliding around the Billy
Goat when the sun went down in the west, a
great, red ball of fire. The evening shadows
were thickening, for night comes quickly in
the mountains.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Lark made splendid time and they
were less than fifty miles from Atkinson
when Tim sighted the gray bank of fog rolling
out of the east. Although fogs were not
uncommon at that time of year he had not
counted on that hazard.</p>

<p class='c008'>With his gas getting low there was only
one thing to do—hammer through and trust
to his compass to bring him over his home
field.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cold, gray banks swallowed the little
plane and Tim was flying in a world alone.
The mist was so thick that Ralph, only a half
dozen feet ahead of him, was only a blurred
outline.</p>

<p class='c008'>On all sides the fog mocked the flying reporter
but he was determined to get through.
A glance at the gas gauge was none too reassuring.
His fuel was running low but if his
calculations were correct, there would be
enough to finish his task.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim turned on the light on his instrument
board for it was quite dark by that time. He
penciled a note to Ralph, asking him how
Perkins was standing the trip. Then Tim
took a wrench and tapped on the fuselage to
attract Ralph’s attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph leaned back and Tim handed him the
message. Two or three minutes later they
repeated the operation, this time transferring
a note from Ralph to Tim. The flying reporter
read his chum’s hasty scrawl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perk’s all right so far but mighty white
and quiet. Do you know where you are?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had to admit that he wasn’t exactly
sure of their location but he kept on hoping
for the best.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim figured that he must be almost
over Atkinson, he dropped as low as he dared,
a careful eye on the altimeter, while he hunted
for a rift in the fog that would allow him to
land.</p>

<p class='c008'>A light spot glowed ahead—perhaps the reflection
of the lights of the city. For a moment
the fog parted and Tim got a fleeting
glimpse of Atkinson. But before he could
locate the airport, the city was blotted from
view.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph, who had been on the lookout, had
seen the lights and now was looking at Tim
expectantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim fumed and raged against the luck of
the elements and while he circled over the city
his precious supply of fuel trickled away. The
motor sputtered and he turned on the emergency
tank enough for twenty minutes more of
flying. Then they’d have to come down and
probably crack-up in the process. It wasn’t
a nice picture that flashed into his mind. Probably
he would be safe enough for his cockpit
was well back in the fuselage, but it would
be tough on Ralph and the unconscious
Perkins. Desperately, Tim searched his mind
for some way out; some way to minimize the
danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>He gripped the controls harder as a plan
took form. Tim put the Lark into a steep
climb and soon reached the 3,000 foot level,
plenty high enough for his purpose. Then
he signalled for Ralph to crawl back into his
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph scrambled back over the fuselage
and his face, illuminated by the light on the
instrument board, showed his amazement at
the plan Tim unfolded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t do that, Tim,” he protested.
“It’s too risky. I won’t stand for it. We’ll
stick by the ship and take our chances.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not on your life,” replied Tim. “We can’t
risk Perk’s life in a crackup and my plan is
the only way out. You take the stick and tend
to business. See you later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With that Tim scrambled into the forward
cockpit where he busied himself, making sure
that Perkins’ head was well bandaged. Then
he unsnapped the safety belt, pulled Perkins
into an almost vertical position, and lashed
the body of the unconscious airman securely
to his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was glad that Perkins was slight in
stature. With a heavier man his plan would
have failed. Somehow he managed to work
himself up on the edge of the cockpit with
Perkins held to him by the safety belt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim looked back at Ralph and waved his
hand reassuringly. Then, aided by a mighty
shove by his feet, he hurled himself into the
fog, pulling Perkins with him. As he fell,
Tim thought he heard a shout from Ralph.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down, down, down they tumbled before
Tim could find the ring and jerk his parachute.
It was an eternity before he heard the
pilot chute crack open to be followed a moment
later by a dull sort of an explosion as the
big chute unfolded and filled with air. A violent
jerk stopped their mad descent and Tim
hugged Perkins closer to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Maybe he had been foolhardy to desert the
ship and trust to the silken umbrella to get
them down, but it had seemed the only way to
protect Perkins from what was sure to be a
crash if they stayed by the plane. Tim figured
that they would get nothing more than a hard
bump when they landed and he could swing
Perkins around and shield him. Ralph was
fully capable of taking care of himself and
the fortune in securities they had salvaged
from the wreck of the air express.</p>

<p class='c008'>Far away Tim heard the sound of an airplane
motor. Probably his own ship. He hoped
that the Lark wouldn’t be wrecked when
Ralph was forced down.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sound of the motor came nearer. It
was the Lark for Tim knew its song by
heart. Suddenly his face blanched. Somewhere
to his right the plane was roaring down on
them through the fog. With Ralph’s visibility
at zero, it might run into them and chew them
to pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim strained to one side as he listened to
the higher note of the motor. He grasped the
shrouds of the parachute, ready to spill
the air from the chute in an attempt to escape
the plane if it was necessary. The added burden
of carrying Perkins was a cruel strain on
his body.</p>

<p class='c008'>The roar of the motor filled the heavens as
the Lark flashed out of the fog. Tim cried out
in agony and horror for they were directly
in the path of the ship. He closed his eyes and
pulled the shrouds with every ounce of
strength left in his weary body. They dropped
earthward quickly as the air spilled from the
chute.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Tim’s tired mind had not acted quickly
enough. Although they escaped the deadly
whirl of the propeller, the tail of the plane
took a husky bite at the chute. A great chunk
of the strong silk wedged itself into the tail
assembly and Tim’s body was almost jerked
apart as he was pulled upward and after the
plane. It couldn’t last long; it was more than
his body could stand. He screamed under the
agony of the awful strain and his eyes stared
upward into Ralph’s terror-stricken face, as
he fought to protect the unconscious Perkins
while they were pulled through the sky like
the tail of a great rocket.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c009'>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The burden of the chute slowed the plane.
Then it leaped almost vertically as Ralph attempted
to free it from the human burden it
was dragging through the sky. The whole
thing required a second, not more than two,
when part of the tail assembly gave way and
the chute started its downward course again.
It had been an endless span of years to Tim,
who sobbed aloud as they drifted through the
fog.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lights pierced the mist below and Tim instinctively
swung around to protect Perkins
when they landed. But they didn’t land. The
chute caught in a maze of telephone wires
along one of the main highways on the outskirts
of Atkinson and Tim and Perkins
dangled just above the ground. Passing motorists
released them and rushed them to a
hospital where Perkins was given immediate
attention and Tim was put to bed after a
thorough massage to ease his strained muscles.
But not until he had telephoned the office
and dictated the first part of the story of their
finding of the wreck of the air mail and their
sensational trip above Atkinson with the injured
pilot.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim, who had been almost forcibly put in
bed by the hospital attendants, was protesting
that he had work to do when Ralph burst
into the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you all right, Tim?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure,” replied Tim. “How about yourself
and the plane?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Both O. K.,” said Ralph. “I blew out a
couple of tires in landing and broke the prop,
but that’s all. How’s Perk?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim turned to the head surgeon who had
just entered the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’ll be back in the air in a few days,”
said the surgeon. “He has a nasty crack on
the head and it was a good thing you got him
here when you did. Much more exposure and
he would have had pneumonia.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The surgeon had just stepped from the
room when the managing editor of the News
hurried in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wonderful work, Tim,” said Carson.
“Wonderful. We put out an extra on the story
you phoned. Now let’s have the rest of it.
This Sky Hawk angle makes it the most thrilling
yarn of the year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For the better part of half an hour, Tim
and Ralph related their experiences while a
stenographer took down their story.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next day the Sky Hawk’s daring robbery
and their rescue of the air mail flyer
were the talk of the town. Before noon, Tim
was visited by Hunter, who was not only
manager of the local field, but representative
for the Transcontinental company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter looked worried and his words bore
out his looks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This Sky Hawk is getting to be a nuisance,”
he told Tim. “He’s picked us for
$500,000 and although we had it covered by
insurance, it doesn’t help matters any. Old
Tom Blair, who heads our company, has wired
me to use every means to apprehend the Sky
Hawk. The police and state officials are doing
all they can, but the very nature of his operations
leaves them almost helpless.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Flying cops are something for the future,”
smiled Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And that’s just what we need,” went on
Hunter. “I want you to agree to help me all
you can. Keep your eyes peeled and your ears
close to the ground. You may be able to turn
up something the police can’t uncover. And
remember, Tim,” he grinned, “there’ll be
something more than just the fun of a story
if you get the Sky Hawk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know I’ll do everything I can,” replied
Tim, as Hunter, weighed down with his
worries, said goodbye.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the Sky Hawk seemed to have dropped
from sight. There was a dearth of news and
the managing editor cast anxious eyes about
for interesting material with which to fill
the columns of his paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ever since he had been given the assignment
as the flying reporter, Tim had cherished
the hope that some day he would be given permission
to write a daily column on aviation.
That day had been particularly quiet and devoid
of stories with interest and to Tim it
seemed the right time to approach his managing
editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the rush of the final edition had subsided
and the presses were roaring their symphony
of news, Tim accosted the managing
editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure I can give you a column of live
news about aviation every day, Mr. Carson,”
he said. “We’re not running very heavy on
news right now and if you’ll give me the
space, I’d like to show you what I can do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When would you have the time to handle
it, Tim?” asked the managing editor. “I
couldn’t spare you for two or three hours
every day for that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not asking for that,” replied Tim. “If
you’ll give me a column, I’ll write the stories
after hours and in the evening. I know most
of the flyers at the field here and then with
the chaps who are flying the air mail, there is
an unlimited field for human interest stories.
On top of that, I’m keeping right up on all the
developments of aviation. All I need is the
space, Mr. Carson!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When do you want to start it?” asked
Carson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any time you can give me the room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you whip a column of material into
shape by tomorrow morning?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Easily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then have about three pages of copy ready
in the morning.” The action was characteristic
of Carson. In fact, it was characteristic of
newspaper work with its quick decisions and
demands that to any class of men but reporters
would have been insurmountable.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Tim the demand for a column of copy
in the morning was the best news in weeks
and he turned away from the managing editor
after expressing his appreciation for the opportunity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Tim,” called Carson. “Better stop on
your way down stairs and tell the engraving
department to work up one and two column
heads for you. Have them draw a picture of
a plane and put your name under it: By Tim
Murphy, the Flying Reporter of the Atkinson
News.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Getting together a column of interesting,
readable material on such short notice would
not be easy, especially since Tim wanted his
first column to be alive with interest. After
conferring with the head of the engraving
department, Tim hurried out to the municipal
field where he imparted his good luck into
the ever-sympathetic ear of Hunter, the field
manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s fine, Tim,” congratulated Hunter.
“I know you’ve wanted to write a daily column
on aviation for a long time. Do you think
Carson will make it a permanent feature of
the paper?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That all depends on what kind of material
I can dig up and how well I can write it.
Means you fellows here at the field will have
to cooperate with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know we’ll do that Tim,” promised
Hunter. “The boys all like you mighty well.
The only thing is that they are a bit bashful in
telling some of their own experiences. You
may have to pry around a bit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I expect you’re right there,” agreed Tim,
“but after I get them started I’ll get plenty of
material. Now I’ve got to line up a good feature
to start the column off tomorrow. You
know of anything unusual here at the field?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter scratched his head and looked meditatively
at a cloud as if seeking inspiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Afraid I’m not much help right now,” he
said. “Say, wait a minute. We’ll go over to
the radio shack and see if there are any late
bulletins on planes coming in tonight.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim agreed and they walked over to the
little building at the foot of the radio towers
where the department of commerce maintained
a station, part of its transcontinental
link of communication to advise airmen on
weather conditions and report the movements
of aircraft along the main skyways.</p>

<p class='c008'>The operator on duty greeted them cordially
and turned his file of messages over to
them. Hunter thumbed through the flimsy
sheets of tissue with experienced fingers. He
stopped and read one of the communications
with interest. Then he turned to Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s something that came in within the
last hour,” he said. “May be just what you
need for a story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim read the tissue and glowed with excitement
at what he read. What a lucky break for
him. According to the report, Arthur Winslow,
king of the air mail flyers, would land at
the local field within two hours for an overnight
stop.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just what I need,” exclaimed Tim.
“Why Winslow is rated as the ace of all airmen.
It will make a great yarn if he’ll talk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There may be some trouble on that point,”
said Hunter. “I know Winslow only slightly
for he’s flying on the west end of the transcontinental
now, and he’s mighty reticent
when it comes to talking about himself. It says
here that he is ferrying a new passenger and
mail plane west.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good thing I have a car here,” said Tim.
“If I can’t get a chance at him any other way
I can offer him a ride to the city and he can
hardly refuse to talk then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think he’ll help you out if you explain
what you want and how badly you need a good
story for the first day your column is printed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went into Hunter’s office where the
manager of the field busied himself at his
desk. Tim dug into the files to secure, in advance,
all of the available material he could
about Arthur Winslow, airman without peer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ace of the air mail pilots was not a
sensational flyer in the sense that his name
was on the front pages of the newspapers
every day. In fact, he was just the opposite
and as he often told his friends, he didn’t
care anything about being the best air mail
flyer. All he wanted was to be the oldest.</p>

<p class='c008'>Winslow had trained Col. Charles A. Lindbergh
when he was a fledgling and before the
flying colonel had even dreamed of a flight to
Paris, and he had performed many a heroic
deed as he winged his way across the plains
of the middle west of the snow-capped Rockies
and the rugged Sierras.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was still finding valuable material in
the files when a mechanic stuck his head in the
door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here comes Winslow,” he announced and
Tim and Hunter promptly deserted the office
and took their places at one side of the big
concrete apron which marked the end of the
main runway on the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plane rapidly took form as it roared
out of the east. Winslow swung low over the
field to sight the wind sock, then lined southwest
and floated down to a three point landing.
There was nothing startling in the way
he handled his plane but his every move revealed
the hand of a master birdman.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Winslow had given his orders to the
mechanics, he greeted Hunter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Winslow,” said the field manager as he
introduced Tim, “here’s a young newspaper
man I want you to know, Tim Murphy of the
Atkinson News. I think Tim is unique in the
newspaper world. He’s not only a mighty
good reporter but a fine flyer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Both Tim and Winslow smiled at Hunter’s
introduction and Tim felt a friendly tingle as
he grasped Winslow’s hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve heard of you,” said Winslow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I’ve heard a great deal about you,”
replied Tim, “so I guess that makes us even.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tim’s up against a tough proposition,”
said Hunter as they strolled toward the office.
“He wants to run a daily column of aviation
in his paper and only today convinced his managing
editor that it ought to be given a trial.
As a result, Tim has to have a column of material
ready early tomorrow morning. On top
of that, he’s going to do this aviation column
on his own time. He wants it to go over big
and become a permanent part of the paper and
so do I. Down here at the field we think it
would be a fine thing and when we saw you
were coming in for an over-night stop, we
figured you might be able to give Tim some
material that would be mighty readable.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think I’ve done anything very remarkable
or anything that would make good
newspaper reading,” laughed Winslow, “but
if you’re willing to have dinner with me up
town, Murphy, we’ll see what we can dig up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was pleased at the invitation and accepted
it at once. He was having even better
luck than he had dared dream, and he felt that
given enough time with Winslow, the famous
pilot would loosen up and tell him some of
the experiences he had had in his eighteen
years of flying.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hunter excused himself, saying that he had
work at the field which required his attention,
and Tim and Winslow got into the car Tim
had brought to the field, and started for town.</p>

<p class='c008'>They talked of the recent developments in
aviation and of the great increase in the number
of air mail lines, but it was not until they
were at dinner that Winslow really started to
unburden himself in answer to Tim’s questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When did I start to fly?” mused the veteran
of the skyways. “Why that’s so long ago
I’ve almost forgotten the date. You young
fellows think of flying as a development since
the war, but I started flying back in 1912 in
the days before we had ailerons on the wing
tips and used to warp the wings of our planes
to control them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve flown more than anyone else,
haven’t you?” queried Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe I have,” was Winslow’s quiet reply.
“My record book shows more than 12,000
hours in the air for a little better than 1,400,000
miles. That would be a long time and a
long ways if it were a continuous flight,” he
smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim liked Winslow when he smiled. There
was nothing of the boaster in this man who
was the king of the air. His brown hair looked
a little faded from exposure in thousands of
hours of sun and wind and storm, and there
were decided wrinkles on his face, but his
eyes were a clear brown that invited confidence
in their owner.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim mentioned the air mail, he struck
an especially responsive chord in Winslow’s
mind, whose life, for the last ten years, had
been a part of the mail. He had flown the first
mail plane from New York to Washington
and later had been one of the pioneer flyers
on the transcontinental.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Those early days were when we got our
thrills,” reminisced Winslow. “We were flying
in cast-off army planes that the post office
department had picked up. Our limit was
under five hundred pounds of mail and we
never had to worry about being overloaded
at that. After the old army DeHaviland’s
were put on the junk heap we got Douglas
cruisers and there was a little more regularity
to the way we maintained our schedules.
When the post office department turned the
air mail over to private contractors, we were
given the best planes money could buy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The air mail’s grown immensely popular
in the last two years hasn’t it?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Immensely is hardly the word,” said
Winslow. “Universally is better, and it’s all since
Lindbergh flew the Atlantic and focused popular
interest on aviation. Why this new plane
I’m ferrying west is capable of carrying six
passengers and 1,500 pounds of mail and
maintaining an average speed of 130 miles an
hour. In two years it will be obsolete and we’ll
have bigger and faster planes in its place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t you take a mail plane several years
ago and brave a Lake Michigan storm in mid-winter
to take food to fishermen marooned
on an island?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was lucky,” was Winslow’s simple reply.
“By the way, I’ve read recently how you did
a similar stunt only you dropped supplies to a
village cut off by a flood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was luck, too,” smiled Tim. “Now
I’d like to know if you’ve ever had any accidents.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“One,” admitted Winslow after some deliberation.
“It was pretty serious and I don’t
know whether I ought to give it to you or not.
But I guess it won’t do any harm,” he added
and smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Someone,” he said, “parked a plane in the
middle of the field at Blanton one night and
when my landing lights didn’t work I ran into
it head-on. Result, two damaged planes and
one bad temper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean that’s the only accident you’ve
had in more than a million miles of flying?”
asked the incredulous Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all and that’s enough,” said Winslow.
“Flying is safe if you take the proper
precautions. The chaps who get cracked-up
are stunting, have inferior equipment, or are
just plain dumb.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What,” asked Tim, “would be the most
thrilling flight to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A hop over the top of the world,” replied
Winslow. “I’ve always wanted to make an
Arctic flight and even though Wilkins and
Eilson made the trip from Point Barrow to
Spitzbergen, I’m not entirely convinced that
there isn’t land somewhere up there. It would
be worth a try, anyway,” and his dark eyes
glowed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim felt a peculiar warmth and thrill of inspiration
and Winslow’s words fell on far
more fertile soil than he ever dreamed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s just one more question?” said
Tim. “Didn’t you help train Lindbergh to
fly?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, some. We were on the same division
of the air mail and saw quite a lot of each
other before he flew to Paris.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What kind of a fellow was he then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not much more than a kid, quiet and serious
minded. If he had any thought of flying
to Paris when I knew him, he certainly kept
it a secret. He’s a wonderful flyer; uses his
head and knows every trick in the game.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had completed their dinner and Winslow,
who was obviously tired from a long day
in the air, asked Tim if he had all the material
he needed for his first column.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reams of it, thanks to you,” said the flying
reporter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad if I have been of any help,” replied
the veteran of the air mail. “I think the
column will be a fine thing. I hope you make
a success of it, and I’m sure you will. I’m going
to turn in now and get a few hours of
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had been too fascinated with their conversation
to take notes during the dinner but
it would have been a waste of effort for he
could remember clearly every scrap of the
information Winslow had given him. He
hurried to his room, gathered up half a dozen
books Dan Watkins had loaned him to study,
and then headed for the copyreader’s rooming
house.</p>

<p class='c008'>He found Dan, in dressing gown and carpet
slippers, enjoying a novel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s up, Tim,” asked Dan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Need some advice and also brought your
books home,” replied Tim. “Carson is going
to let me try a daily aviation column to see
how it goes. I’ve got more material than I
can possibly use for the first time. Just interviewed
Arthur Winslow, dean of the air
mail flyers, and have some stuff that will
make wonderful copy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How much space will you have?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just an even column and I’ve enough dope
for three or four,” said Tim enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s going to be a job, then,” said Dan,
“for you must keep within the limits of your
space. But that means your story will be even
the better—not an extra word or phrase.
Here, use my typewriter and get busy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim welcomed the suggestion and for an
hour he worked diligently, cutting and rewriting
as the copyreader suggested. When
he had completed his task he had a column
story about Winslow—a column that was
fairly alive with the romance of the air mail
and of the flyer who was the master of all
birdmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Carson will like this, you see if he
doesn’t,” was Dan’s comment as he finished
reading Tim’s work. “Keep this up and it
won’t be long until you’ll be the aviation editor
of the News.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you really think so, Dan?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sure of it. Only the other day Carson
was talking about you and I told him how
you were going to night school four evenings
every week and that I was suggesting books
for you to read. He was well pleased. There
aren’t many of the boys on the paper who are
working like you to get ahead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim reached the office early the next morning
and placed his copy on Carson’s desk before
the managing editor arrived. The directing
editorial genius of the News said nothing
about Tim’s first story but after two or three
days he stopped beside the flying reporter’s
desk one morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The aviation stories you’re turning out
are good stuff, Tim,” he commented. “If you
have a little more than a column some days
don’t hesitate to run over your usual amount
of space.”</p>

<p class='c008'>From the fact that Carson was willing to
give him more space, Tim knew that his work
was finding favor. But he hoped for the day
when the managing editor would make it a
permanent feature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim worked every extra minute getting
material for his column. He interviewed all
the famous pilots who landed at the field,
wrote sketches of the flyers on the regular
air mail runs, and described flights over the
city and the surrounding towns. The latter
stunt made a great hit with the circulation
manager, who personally made a trip to the
editorial office to commend Tim. Every town
visited and written up from the air meant
the sale of more copies of the News.</p>

<p class='c008'>With his regular work and his studies, Tim
found the task of gathering and writing the
material for the column a real drain on his
physical energies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better take things a little easier,” cautioned
Dan, but Tim was too much interested
in his work and studies to give up anything
and he was too conscientious to slight
either.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim’s health started to suffer under
the burden, Dan took the matter in his own
hands and went to the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tim’s working too hard,” he told Carson.
“The boy is too ambitious for his own good
and unless you do something he’ll work himself
to death. He’s doing his usual work in
the office, writing his daily column and going
to night school four times a week. That’s
more than he can stand, especially this hot
weather.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad you called it to my attention,”
said the managing editor. “I’ve been very
much pleased over Tim’s column and it’s
made a hit with the business office. We decided
to make a little change last night and
this is a good time to tell Tim about it. Come
along.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They walked down the editorial room together
until they reached Tim’s desk where
the flying reporter, his eyes red-rimmed from
lack of sleep, was working.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold up a minute, Tim,” said the managing
editor. “I have some news for you. We’re
going to discontinue your column.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Mr. Carson,” protested Tim. Then
he stopped abruptly, his tired eyes welling
with tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m sorry, Tim, I shouldn’t have said
it in that way,” Carson hurried on. “What
I meant to tell you is that the column is gone
for good—from now on it will be a regular
department of the paper and you’re to have
charge of it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c009'>CHAPTER NINE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Relieved of the burden of his other duties,
Tim devoted all of his energies to the development
of his aviation department. He chronicled
the arrival and departure of the mail
and express planes at the field in addition to
all of the private ships which made overnight
stops or called for supplies. He also made it
a point to use the plane in covering the dedication
of every new airport in the state and
thus created much good will for his paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day early in May the telegraph editor
handed Tim a short story which had just
come in over the wire. Its contents were such
that Tim picked up the sheet of copy and
started for the managing editor’s desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carson was closing his desk and preparing
to leave the office when Tim accosted him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Mr. Carson,” said the flying reporter.
“I’d like to talk with you for a few
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The managing editor glanced at the clock.
“I haven’t much time, right now,” he said.
“I have an appointment at the dentist’s in
ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It won’t take long,” explained Tim and
he handed the folded paper to the managing
editor, indicating the article which had attracted
his attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carson scanned the item and then re-read
it, his news sense instantly aroused to the
value of the idea behind the story. He smiled
at Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bet you want me to send you and the
News’ plane on this good will air tour,” he
said when he had completed reading the story
for the second time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s it exactly,” enthused Tim. “It
seems to me like a great chance. Good publicity
for the News and at the same time boosting
aviation. According to the tentative plans,
this will be a good will air tour of the state,
open to every licensed pilot and plane, with
stops at all of the larger airports in the state.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wouldn’t it be pretty expensive?” asked
the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not necessarily,” replied Tim. “Gas and
oil would be the main item of expense and the
advertising value of having a plane in the tour
would more than offset the expense.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t be surprised but that you are
right, Tim,” said Carson. “I’ve got to hurry
along for that appointment. I’ll consider your
plan tonight and let you know first thing in
the morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That evening Tim told Ralph of his hope
that the News would enter its plane in the
good will air tour and Ralph agreed that it
would be a great stunt, both from the standpoint
of advertising the paper and of popularizing
aviation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was busy on a handful of rewrites
from the morning papers when the managing
editor stopped at his desk the next day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve decided to enter our plane in the
air tour,” he said. “I talked it over with Mr.
Adams, the advertising manager, and he
agrees that it is an excellent plan. I’m glad
you called it to my attention, Tim. We’ll work
out the details later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim completed his work on the rewrites
he presented himself before the managing
editor’s desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit down, Tim,” said Carson, as he indicated
a chair at his side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We want plenty of local interest in the air
tour,” he went on, “so what do you think
of having a contest to select a name for our
plane?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That sounds fine, Mr. Carson,” replied
Tim heartily. “It ought to arouse interest
here because Atkinson is getting more and
more air-minded. You ought to see the number
of people who come out to the field every day
to watch the planes, and especially when the
transcontinental air mail comes in. There’s
a fascination about flying that’s getting into
everyone’s blood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You certainly have a real case of it,”
laughed the managing editor, “but I’m glad
you have, Tim, for you are doing fine work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now,” he continued, “I want you to take
complete charge of the contest over the naming
of our plane. Offer $100 in prizes to be
distributed in any way you see fit. We want
to stage the contest in one week and you can
have a column a day for your publicity stories.
Select your own judges and give me a name
by next Thursday. Let’s see, this is Tuesday,
that will give you two days to get ready, announce
the contest this Thursday and the winner
in one week. How does that strike you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dandy, Mr. Carson, and thanks a lot for
the opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim threw all his energy into formulating
plans for the big contest and by Monday
morning, three days before the announcement
of the winning name, his desk was piled
high with letters. The deadline for entries
was set for Wednesday at 6 p. m. with the
announcement of the winner in the next day’s
paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first prize was $50, the second best
name would get $25, while the next 25 would
be given honorable mention and $1 apiece.
Tim selected Carl Hunter, “Tiny” Lewis, the
mail pilot, and Ralph to help him open the
letters and judge their contents. By the time
the final mail arrived Wednesday afternoon
more than 5,000 letters had been received
and excitement was at a high pitch. A big
picture of the plane had appeared in the editions
of that day with a question mark on
the side where the winning name would be
placed.</p>

<p class='c008'>All evening long Tim and his helpers ripped
open letters, scanned their contents, and sorted
them as they thought best. It was early morning
when they had completed their task and
narrowed the 5,000 suggestions down to 27
letters. Out of that 27 would come the first
and second place winners and the list of 25
honorable mentions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each one of the judges read the 27 letters
and then wrote down his choice for the first
prize. Tim gathered up the four slips. They
were all alike; every one had agreed on the
name for the plane, the Good News.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim informed the managing editor
of the prize winning name, Carson was elated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Great,” he bubbled, “great! Couldn’t have
been better if I had named it myself. That
ought to make a real hit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The managing editor’s hunch was right
and for the next two or three days there was
a steady stream of visitors at the airport to
inspect the Good News. The contest and the
appropriateness of the name caught the public
fancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the success which attended the selection
of a name for the plane, Carson gave
Tim free rein in writing stories of the good
will air tour which was to start from Prairie
City, the state capital, and finish at Atkinson.
Tim, by dint of much correspondence, persuaded
the officials in charge of the tour to
bring it to a close at Atkinson instead of going
back to Prairie City. The chamber of commerce
woke up to the possibilities of the air
tour. Tim was frequently consulted and the
News occupied a prominent place in the preliminary
arrangements.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day before Tim was to start for
Prairie City to join the air tour, Carson called
him to his desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better take Ralph with you,” he suggested.
“He can relieve you of the burden
of writing a lot of the stories and can also
help you in piloting. I’ll have him take a high
speed camera and he may be able to get some
good action pictures of planes in the clouds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim welcomed the suggestion that Ralph
accompany him for there would be plenty for
two reporters to do and the managing editor
had indicated that he wanted the tour fully
covered. That would mean two or three columns
of news a day in addition to about 250
miles in the air with an average of four stops
a day for each of the five days on the tour.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim and Ralph reached the airport
the next morning ready to start for Prairie
City, the state capital and starting point for
the good will tour, they found Kurt Blandin
waiting for them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello Murphy,” greeted the head of the
Ace flying circus. “Little surprised to see
me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes, Blandin,” admitted Tim.
“You’re more or less of a lone wolf and a
stranger at this field.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right,” smiled Blandin and in spite of
himself, Tim couldn’t help liking the other for
the moment. “I’m entering a plane in the tour
and since you fellows were going, thought
you’d better know my flyer.” Blandin called
to a slightly built man who had been working
over the motor of a nearby biplane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want you to know Daredevil Dugan,”
said Blandin when the other flyer joined them.
Ralph and Tim acknowledged the introduction
but Tim felt an instant wave of dislike
for Dugan. The air circus flyer who was going
on the tour was short of stature, with a
peaked face and eyes that shifted constantly.
There was no question about Dugan’s ability
as a flyer for he had a reputation as a daredevil,
but there might easily be some question
about his ethics.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to make the trip,” said Blandin,
“but I have to ride herd on the bunch of flying
lunatics I’ve got over at my own field. Let
them alone and they might decide to make a
raid on the treasury.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not so sure they wouldn’t get away
with it,” added Tim. He was surprised at the
effect his words had for Blandin’s face
clouded with a sudden fury that shook his entire
body.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you know about my outfit?” he
said hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing,” admitted Tim. “But I’d like to
know a whole lot more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With that he turned and walked over to
the Good News.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why did you stir Blandin up like that?”
asked Ralph.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I honestly don’t know,” replied Tim.
“Maybe it hasn’t got me anywhere and maybe
it has.” He glanced toward the plane
Blandin was entering in the air tour and saw
the head of the flying circus talking with
Dugan. “One thing, though,” he added, “I’m
going to keep my eyes on Dugan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim and Ralph landed the Good
News at Prairie City, they found thirty-one
other flyers and planes registered for the
tour. One side of the big field was lined with
the heavier-than-air craft. At one end a sport
monoplane was almost lost under the wings
of a giant tri-motor and there were cabin
planes of almost every type represented. The
planes were classified in three groups according
to the displacement of their motors but
that arrangement did not affect the Good
News for Tim and Ralph were not competing
for the prizes offered to the flyers with the
best elapsed time in each class.</p>

<p class='c008'>They secured a complete list of the flyers
and their planes, dug up interesting bits about
the famous pilots in the tour, and dispatched
their stories to the News that night.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morning for the start of the state’s
first air tour was bright and clear, with a soft
May wind out of the south; a veteran air
man by the name of “Spin” Beeker, gave the
pilots their final instructions and then waved
them off the field at one minute intervals.</p>

<p class='c008'>The air was alive with the throbbing of
motors, now low, then rising to a crescendo
as each pilot tested his plane, then gunned it
hard for the takeoff. The Good News was
No. 18 in the starting order and Tim sped
down the field and into the air on the first lap
of the five day tour.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first night found them at Rollins, a
crowded factory town, with 325 miles and
three other stops, behind them. The first day
had been successful without even a motor
failure reported for any one of the 32 planes.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the second day one plane threw a connecting
rod through its crankcase and was
forced down in a corn field while on the third
day another pilot washed out his landing
gear when he came down on the field at
Marion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The noon stop on the fourth day was made
at Newton where the flyers were given a reception
and dinner in the hangar at the airport.
They were late in getting away for the
two afternoon hops and Beeker was sending
them away at half minute intervals. When he
waved his flag at Tim, the flying reporter
opened up his throttle and sent the Good
News scooting down the field. The sound of
another motor, near at hand, drew Tim’s
attention for a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some pilot, evidently mistaking Beeker’s
signal for his own, was speeding down the
field for a takeoff. Evidently he had not seen
Tim for in another second their courses would
converge. Tim, acting by instinct, pulled his
stick back hard and at the same time jammed
the throttle to the end of its arc.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a risky thing to do but he fairly
jerked his plane off the ground. The Good
News shot skyward, then settled rapidly, but
Tim leveled off and after a shaky moment,
was heading for the next control point. He
had fairly hopped his plane over the other
ship. It had been a master bit of flying.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was unable to identify the other plane
and it was not until they landed at Beldon, the
night stop, that he learned the name of its
pilot.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim and Ralph had hardly climbed from
their plane when “Daredevil” Dugan, accosted
them with bitter words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoever told you two pencil pushers you
could fly,” he cried. “What do you think this
is, a game of Washington tag? You came
mighty near wrecking me back there at Newton.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dugan’s attitude angered Tim, who felt
that he was in no way responsible for the
mixup which had occurred at the noon control
station. Before he could answer someone
else joined in the party.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s this you’re saying, Dugan?” The
voice was cold with sarcasm and “Daredevil”
Dugan swung around to face “Spin” Beeker,
the head judge. “Don’t you think you’d better
pull in your oars,” continued Beeker. “I’ve a
good mind to disqualify you for that stunt
you pulled back at Newton. Trying to blame
these boys, are you? Not while ‘Spin’ Beeker’s
judging this tour, you won’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You deliberately jumped your flag,” he
accused Dugan, “and if Tim says you go out,
out you go. What do you say, Tim?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim knew that Dugan had a good chance
to win first prize in the Class C division for
small planes and the call down the field judge
had given the “Daredevil” more than satisfied
him for the injustice he felt from Dugan’s
accusation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that’s all over now, Mr. Beeker,”
said Tim. “Only a misunderstanding and it’s
better to forget all about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just as you say,” agreed the head judge,
as he turned back to Dugan, but the Daredevil
was already on his way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim watched Dugan as he hurried toward
a waiting car. Was it possible that the Daredevil
had deliberately attempted to crash
them? His thoughts flashed back to the scene
at the Atkinson airport and his words with
Blandin. Could the boss of the flying circus
have instructed Dugan to get them? It was
a question Tim himself couldn’t answer and
he decided to let things take their course after
promising himself that he would keep a closer
watch than ever on Dugan.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the final day of the air tour, Tim, in
recognition for his work in promoting the big
aviation day at Atkinson, was given the lead-off
position and he swept away from the Beldon
airport at the head of the caravan of
thirty planes.</p>

<p class='c008'>When familiar scenes again came into view
and Tim sighted the field at Atkinson, he was
astounded at the size of the crowd which
had gathered to see the end of the tour. Every
side of the field was jammed with cars, parked
row on row, and police and national guardsmen
were hard put to keep the milling thousands
from sweeping on to the landing field.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had pushed his plane hard and was
nearly ten minutes ahead of the others. To
keep the interest of the crowd he stunted
over the field, looping, falling and zooming
in manoeuvres that had the crowd gasping
for breath. When he saw the first of the
planes in the tour heading in from the west,
he nosed down for the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ping! For a second Tim did not realize
what had happened. Ralph, in the forward
cockpit, had heard the noise and he looked
around at the flying reporter. Tim wiggled
his stick and it was then that he discovered
their predicament. The main control wire to
the ailerons on the left wing had parted and
was dangling from the wing. By rare good
luck the Good News had been in an easy dive
when the accident occurred and had leveled
off of its own accord.</p>

<p class='c008'>Below, Tim could see the banked masses
of humanity. They’d come out for a thrill,
had they? Well, they’d get it but he didn’t
dare risk a crackup in the crowd. The slogan
all through the tour had been to play safe and
now here he was up better than 3,000 feet
and with a slim chance of getting down alive.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph had sensed what they were up
against and was staring back, the color
drained from his face. Tim wondered what
his own face looked like. Probably he was
just as white as Ralph for he was sure enough
up against it. What irony! After spending
days promoting the aviation day to mark the
close of the air tour, then an accident like this.
If he could only get his hands on that strand
of loose wire he might be able to get the ship
down after all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim motioned to Ralph, who leaned back
until the flying reporter could make his shouts
understood. Ralph’s eyes got as big as cart
wheels and his mouth dropped open but he
nodded and took a firm grip on his nerve.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carefully the two men in the little plane
started to move. Tim thanked his lucky stars
that Ralph was a competent flyer and he was
ready to bless his managing editor for his
foresight in having another reporter trained
as an aviator.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the 25,000 packed around the airport it
was something new in the way of thrills. To
Tim and Ralph it meant taking their lives on
luck and consummate nerve for they had sacrificed
their parachutes to make room for their
baggage on the five day tour. Tim edged forward
and Ralph slid back. In less than a minute
they had exchanged places and Ralph was
giving the plane an easy rudder to swing it
back toward the airport.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim stretched his six feet of muscular body
over the side of the forward cockpit as Ralph
headed for the field. His nerves were remarkably
calm; he felt sure he could accomplish
the task before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim swung both legs over the side of the
cockpit. Ralph had throttled the motor down
as slow as he dared but even then the blast
of air from the propeller tore at Tim. The
flying reporter anchored his right foot in the
step in the fuselage while his right hand was
locked in the safety belt which was too short
to go around his body as he swung from the
side of the ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>The broken aileron wire dangled tantalizingly
from the wing. Tim gauged his distance
and thrust an outstretched hand to grasp it.
The wire was just beyond his reach!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c009'>CHAPTER TEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The good will planes were swarming in from
the west. In another minute there would be
a dozen of them circling over the airport and
with his own ship able to manoeuvre with
only the greatest difficulty, Tim knew that the
arrival of the other planes would add more
complications to their plight.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Good News was wavering unsteadily.
At any moment it might slide into a spin in
spite of all that Ralph could do to keep it on
an even keel. Then it would be curtains! But
not if Tim could help it. He was determined
to reach the dangling wire if it was humanly
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter started his body swinging.
Ralph screamed at him for the Good
News was careening from side to side. But
Tim kept on, his body swinging out from the
side of the plane like a great pendulum, its
swings ever lengthening.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim clutched at the broken wire; missed
by inches. The next time he’d make it. He had
to, he told himself, for every second was precious.
They couldn’t smash up in the crowd
below. He swung again, his fingers outstretched
in an effort that wrenched every
muscle in his body. He touched the dangling
wire, but it slipped through his hand. Then
a movement of the plane placed it within his
reach again and he gripped the wire between
his finger-tips. He heard Ralph’s triumphant
shout as he tightened his grasp on
the wire and felt the plane nose downward,
but the world was dancing before his eyes.
The strain was intense as he hung on like
grim death, his left hand holding and controlling
the aileron wire, his other hand and
foot anchored to the fuselage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down they circled, Tim mechanically manipulating
the aileron. Truly he was “riding
down” from the clouds. He’d read about it
being in the war but had hardly believed it
possible. Now he was actually accomplishing
the feat and getting away with it—maybe.
They weren’t down yet. Could Ralph turn
the trick and make a safe landing? It would
require real skill and a keen judgment of
distance and speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim glanced back at his chum and Ralph
nodded reassuringly. He knew as well as Tim
that if he landed too hard Tim would be
bounced off the plane and even an Irishman,
and a reporter at that, doesn’t like to be
thrown from a plane landing at a speed of
seventy miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph straightened out and headed for the
field. Tim steadied himself and uttered a
prayer as they dropped closer to the ground.
They were over the edge of the field and nosing
down fast. Tim glanced at the crowd—a
sea of upturned faces. He gave the aileron
a final jerk and shut his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bang! Crash! Bump! And they were down.
The shock of the rough landing threw Tim
against the fuselage and he clung there like
a plaster. Ralph managed to taxi the Good
News across the field and brought it up in
front of the announcer’s stand and they tumbled
down. Above them the sky was alive with
planes. They had turned the trick just in time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before the crowds surrounded them and
swept them toward the announcer’s stand,
Tim had a second to examine the aileron
wire. The break was clean-cut; no frayed
ends to indicate an accident due to normal
wear and tear. The only thing that could
have caused a break like that was a sharp
file wielded by spiteful hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was so mad he couldn’t talk but by
the time they found their managing editor, he
had cooled down somewhat. They explained
what had happened and then Tim swept Ralph
off his feet when he told Carson about his
discovery of the filed wire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not going to accuse anyone right
now,” said the flying reporter, his eyes pin
points of anger, “But when ‘Daredevil’ Dugan
lands he’s going to tell me what I want
to know or he’ll get the worst beating he ever
had.” And Tim, moved by emotion, looked
fully capable of carrying out his threat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim and Ralph were called to the announcer’s
stand where they were introduced
to the crowd and the master of ceremonies
briefly related how they had ridden down
from the clouds. A great roar of applause
swept over the crowd and Tim was genuinely
embarrassed at the ovation.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as they could get away, Tim and
Ralph slid out of the stand, and lost themselves
in the crowd.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you seen Dugan land?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He came in about five minutes ago and
is well down toward the other end of the
field,” replied Ralph. “He’s slated to do his
daredevil stuff right away so we’ll have to
hurry if we want to catch him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They made slow progress through the
packed mass of humanity and were not more
than halfway down the field when the loud
speakers blared out an announcement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” boomed the metallic
voice, “you will now see ‘Daredevil’
Dugan, the prince of thrills, in an aerial exhibition
which is without peer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’ll be an exhibition without peer when
I get my hands on Dugan,” muttered Tim
as he heard the motor of the Daredevil’s plane
come to life. There was no chance of reaching
Dugan before he started so Tim and Ralph
crowded their way to front line places.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dugan’s little biplane shot down the field.
The tail flipped into the air and the under
carriage sailed clear. Then Dugan bounced
his ship up and down as he sped alone, never
more than five feet above the ground. It
was old stuff but mighty dangerous, especially
if the motor failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crowd was yelling and milling excitedly
as Dugan’s plane neared the fence on
the far boundary. Tim wondered how long
Dugan would wait before he nosed his ship
up. Then he caught his breath for the daredevil
was living up to his name.</p>

<p class='c008'>The biplane shot skyward but Dugan had
waited a fraction of a second too long. There
was the sharp crashing of wood and to the
crowd’s amazement and horror, Dugan left
his landing gear hanging on the fence. But
probably no one was more surprised and
startled than the daredevil himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alive to the emergency, Tim forgot his
personal feelings toward Dugan and with
Ralph at his heels pushed his way to the announcer’s
stand. There he found a group of
perplexed and worried officials who were
looking on helplessly while Dugan cruised
over the field. The crowd recovered its breath,
and, mob-like, got all ready for a real thrill
when Dugan landed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim cornered Clyde Bennett, the owner of
the great tri-motored monoplane which had
been on the good will tour. Tim’s plan won
Bennett’s hearty approval and together they
explained it to the officials. Several hesitated
but “Spin” Beeker acclaimed it the only way
to avert tragedy. When he presented that
angle of the situation, the other officials immediately
gave their consent. They didn’t
mind giving the crowd its share of thrills,
but at the same time they didn’t want tragedy
to play a major role in the events of the day
if it was humanly possible to prevent it.</p>

<p class='c008'>While Tim and Bennett warmed up the
motors of the great transport plane, Ralph
went in search of rope. He was back in less
than five minutes staggering under his load.
They boosted the coils of manilla into the
cabin of the big ship and Tim, who had been
delegated to handle the controls, was just
taking his place when the fiery little managing
editor of the News arrived. Carson had gotten
wind of what was in the air and was
thoroughly aroused. He collared Tim and
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re crazy,” he yelled. “I won’t let you
go on such a foolhardy trip. You’ll all get
killed and I can’t afford to lose two of my
best reporters.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re crazy yourself if you think we’re
not going,” shouted Tim in reply. “Some
one’s got to help Dugan down. They say he
isn’t carrying a parachute. And besides,” he
suggested, appealing to Carson’s nose for
news, “it will make a great story for the
paper.” The managing editor weakened and
waved them on. Ralph banged the door of the
cabin and Tim fed the fuel into the eager
cylinders of the tri-motor. He was mighty
glad now that he had taken a course in handling
big ships at the flying school.</p>

<p class='c008'>While they were gaining altitude, Tim
scrawled a note, weighed it down with a
wrench, and tied it to a stout, light cord. In
less than five minutes they were over the
daredevil’s plane. Ralph pushed open a window
in the cabin of the transport and paid
out the cord to which the note was attached.
A moment of jockeying and the note was in
Dugan’s hands. The daredevil tore it from
the wrench, read it hastily, and then waved
his understanding to his rescuers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two planes forged westward, gradually
gaining more altitude. They wanted
plenty of room and the sun at their backs
when they started to give the 25,000 spectators
on the ground the greatest thrill of
the day—a thrill that would surpass anything
on the scheduled program. Five miles west of
the airport they swung around, their tails to
the setting sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dugan’s crippled plane was a little ahead
and above the tri-motor. The air speed
indicator in the big monoplane pointed to 80
miles an hour. Tim took a fresh grip on the
controls while Ralph and Bennett made sure
that their ropes were ready.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gap between the two ships gradually
closed. Tim was handling the great tri-motor
like a veteran.</p>

<p class='c008'>The daredevil’s plane was now just ahead
and a few feet above him. Dugan was looking
back at the monoplane and handling his
own little plane with the skill of a magician.
They were almost together; then Dugan’s
plane was hidden by the great wing of the
tri-motor. Tim moved the controls slightly
and held his breath. The monoplane rose
gently, there was a rasping bump as the daredevil’s
ship, minus its landing gear, settled
on top of the great gray monoplane.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a shout, Ralph and Bennett swarmed
out of the cabin and onto the wings. While
Dugan nursed his motor carefully and kept
his ship plastered tight against the wing of
the tri-motor, the other two lashed the little
biplane down. In the cockpit of the big ship
Tim was fighting with his controls.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carefully Tim pushed the big gray bird
along while the men on the wing hurried to
complete their task. A careless maneuver,
and the biplane might be dislodged and brush
them into space. After an eternity for Tim,
they scrambled into the cabin with news that
they had done everything possible to lash the
damaged plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again it was up to Tim. Slowly the tri-motor
drifted earthward. Perhaps Tim was
the only one of the four who fully realized
their new danger and he kept his own counsel
and nerved himself for the task ahead.
But he couldn’t help wondering whether the
damaged plane was lashed securely. If there
was very much slack in the ropes the ship
above would bounce when they landed, smash
through the great wing and crush them in a
trap that would carry them to their deaths
at sixty miles an hour, their landing speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the others were laughing over the
thrill of the trip, Tim held their lives in his
hands. He was tired, dead tired. The good
will trip had been fatiguing and the strain
of his sensational landing earlier in the afternoon
had taken more of his strength than
he had realized. But it was too late now to
turn the controls over to Bennett. They were
at the edge of the field. Tim killed speed with
every trick on the list. The roar of the crowd
came to his ears as the tri-motor, with “Daredevil”
Dugan’s plane resting on top, passed
overhead.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ground loomed before Tim’s tired
eyes as he swung around into the wind for
the landing. The shadows of late afternoon
were deceptive and his eyes burned from the
strain. He felt himself slipping, losing control;
then with a mighty effort he came back.
The lives of the other three in the plane, as
well as his own, depended on his skill. And he
couldn’t crack up in front of that great crowd!
Tim gave the controls a final twist and placed
his trust in the guardian angel who looks
after flyers. The heavy under-carriage
smacked the ground. Tim heard the wing
creak and groan in protest at the weight of
Dugan’s plane. Involuntarily he ducked.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the wing held and Tim brought the
tri-motor to a stop a little past the middle of
the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim reached the door of the tri-motor
he found Dugan waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quick, Murphy,” said the daredevil.
“Come around to the other side. I’ve got
something I must tell you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When they reached the far side of the
tri-motor, Dugan burst forth in voluble explanation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blandin ordered me to crack you up on
the tour,” he explained. “That’s why we almost
crashed at Newton. When I didn’t get
you then, I filed the aileron wires on your
ship. I’ve got to get out now, skip the country.
I failed to get you and Blandin will break
me in two if he ever finds me. Thanks for
saving me just now. I’ll repay you some day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before Tim could answer, Dugan had
slipped away and was lost in the crowd which
had surged through the police lines and gathered
around the tri-motor. Tim and Dugan
were to meet again but under circumstances
that even Tim hardly would have believed
possible.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c009'>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With the advent of late spring, aviation
became the news of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Flyers were planning trans-Atlantic hops,
endurance tests and Arctic exploration. The
adventure which held Tim’s interest was the
Arctic flight which Capt. Rayburn Rutledge,
famed explorer, was planning across the top
of the world. Not entirely satisfied with the
efforts of other aerial explorers, Rutledge
still hoped to find a hidden continent under
the ice and snow of the Northland.</p>

<p class='c008'>A great newspaper syndicate had undertaken
to finance his trip and Tim’s paper
had contributed $1,000. Tim read every word
of Rutledge’s plans with avid interest, and
made a thorough study of the conditions in
the Arctic. It was just the flight he had
dreamed about ever since Arthur Winslow,
dean of the air mail flyers, had planted the
seed in his mind only a few months before.</p>

<p class='c008'>On his trip to the west coast, Rutledge
stopped in Atkinson and in his interview with
the explorer, Tim learned in detail of the
plans for the flight over the top of the world.
Then Rutledge soared over the Great Smokies
on his way to Seattle, his embarkation
point for Alaska.</p>

<p class='c008'>The big news came unexpectedly. Rutledge
had been injured in an automobile accident
in Seattle; was definitely out of the flight
for that year, yet the plane was ready, fully
equipped, supplies had been shipped to the far
north, and every detail cared for. The time
for the adventure was ripe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim read and dreamed and when his managing
editor, speaking for the newspaper syndicate,
asked him to take over the flight and
carry on, Tim’s happiness knew no bounds.
He felt it was the opportunity of a lifetime
and within an hour after his acceptance, word
was sent out on the humming press association
wires that Tim Murphy and Ralph Parsons,
the flying reporters of the Atkinson
News, would attempt the daring Arctic adventure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another month elapsed before they were
ready to leave Atkinson on the start of their
long trip. Tim spent his last evening with
Dan Watkins in the quiet of his friend’s
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dan had gone over all the plans with
Tim and agreed that they had an excellent
chance to succeed in their mission.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And here’s a bit of good news, Tim,” he
added, just before the flying reporter took his
leave, “I have a hunch that if you succeed
Carson will make you the aviation editor of
the News.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You really think so, Dan?” Tim’s words
reflected his hope and eagerness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I certainly do,” replied the copy reader.
“From what I accidentally overheard this
afternoon when he was talking with the business
manager, things are all set—providing
you succeed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I’ll make it across the top of the
world or bust up in the attempt,” said Tim
determinedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The farewells the next day were brief for
there is little time on a daily paper for leave-taking
and Tim and Ralph were glad that it
was so. A few sincere good wishes from Dan
and their managing editor, and they found
themselves on the Overland limited, bound
for the coast where they would embark for
the voyage along the coast to Alaska.</p>

<p class='c008'>A week later when their steamer pulled
away from the dock, Tim gazed at Seattle’s
skyline but his thoughts were in the far north
as they churned down Puget sound. He was
actually bound for the Arctic! Really going
to fly across the heart of the great unknown!</p>

<p class='c008'>His dream had not been a dream after all
but he was sensible enough to realize that only
by hard work and the whole-hearted cooperation
of Ralph had he been able to turn his
dream into a reality. Good old steady Ralph.
Perhaps he wasn’t the speediest sort of a
fellow but he was reliable and could always
be counted on in coming through in a crisis.
And after all that was what counted on such
an adventure as they were facing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trip up the coast and into the interior
of Alaska was uneventful. When they reached
Fairbanks they found that their plane had
arrived safely and mechanics were already at
work assembling it. Days passed like hours as
they made their final preparations and it was
June before Tim announced that they were
ready to make the first hop of their long trip.</p>

<p class='c008'>On a bright morning in early June they
loaded their equipment into the monoplane,
waved goodbye to mechanics who had helped
so enthusiastically, and headed northward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then—fog!</p>

<p class='c008'>Cold, bone chilling blasts from the Arctic
swirled around the high peaks of the Endicott
range and forced the trim, gray monoplane
plane up and up. Inside the cabin of the little
ship Tim and Ralph were eagerly trying to
see through the drifting fog banks ahead and
below them. The air was bitter cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seemed hours to them since they had
skimmed over the field at Fairbanks, flirted
the tail of the plane into the air and headed
northward across the heart of Alaska for
Point Barrow, the northernmost outpost of
civilization in that part of North America.
For over an hour the weather had been cold
but clear—then the dreaded fog. It had forced
them higher and higher until they were almost
at the ceiling for their heavily loaded
plane. For four hours they had plunged
blindly ahead, depending solely on their instruments
and hoping against hope that they
were still on their course.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim pored over his charts while Ralph
handled the stick. Even a slight deviation
from their course would cause them to miss
Point Barrow and either go far out over the
Arctic Ocean or come down at some lonely
spot in the interior of Alaska.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim nudged Ralph and pointed to the clock
on the instrument board. They had been in
the air a little more than five hours. If the
fog would only clear they might sight Point
Barrow. But the fog refused to lift.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was useless to go further north and with
a bitter face Tim stared down at the drifting
banks of gray. A flight across the top of the
world—it was the ambition of his life and
now, at the very outset, they were apparently
doomed to failure through a whim of nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph’s features were set in equally bitter
lines for he knew how much the proposed
flight over the top of the world meant to the
young explorer. Even in the face of disaster
few words passed their lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now months of planning were worthless
before the drifting gray clouds. Helplessly,
the men in the monoplane cruised
around and around, desperately clinging to
the hope that the fog would clear. The minutes
were speeding, drinking great gulps of
precious fuel and their time in the air was
nearing an end.</p>

<p class='c008'>In less than an hour they would be forced
to plunge down through the fog to whatever
fate the gods of the air had prepared for them.
If luck was with them, they might land without
cracking up too badly and with the rifles,
concentrated food and snowshoes which they
had in the plane preparatory to their hop off
from Point Barrow, they might be able to
reach Barrow or find some trapper’s cabin.
They might—but the chances were slim and
Tim and Ralph now made no attempt to hide
their anxiety.</p>

<p class='c008'>Half an hour more of gas; half an hour
more of life. The chill of the Arctic was
creeping into their bones; their faces were
white with the cold and the little thermometer
on the side of the ship registered well below
zero. Anything but pleasant weather for a
forced landing and probable smashup.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Ralph let out a yell. Far to the right
there was a rift in the fog and without a
moment’s hesitation, he headed for it with
the motor on full. They shot downward in
a long glide, down and through the walls of
gray—down and underneath the fog, which
was lifting rapidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ahead of them was the rugged coast of
North Alaska and Tim managed to get his
bearings. They were not more than eight or
ten miles west of Point Barrow. With lighter
hearts and a motor that was singing sweetly
in spite of the sub-zero temperature, they
skimmed along the coast. Less than ten minutes
later they swooped low over the huddle of
buildings that is Point Barrow and out to the
pack ice where they landed, turned around,
and taxied back toward the village to be
greeted by the handful of Eskimos and the
crew of the government radio station.</p>

<p class='c008'>After hasty greetings, Tim and Ralph, still
bundled in their heavy clothes, turned their
attention to the plane and refused to leave it
until they had satisfied themselves that everything
thing was O.K.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early the next day they were back on the
ice, working over the monoplane, repacking
their equipment and filling the gas and oil
tanks, for now that they were ready, they
intended to take advantage of the first favorable
weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was whistling as he worked in the
cockpit, making a final inspection, while Ralph
busied himself on the motor. Carefully he
checked the equipment, the supply of concentrated
food, snowshoes, knives, rifles, and
a hood and heater for the motor. A forced
landing in the heart of the Arctic would not
find them unprepared and the stout, specially
constructed wooden cockpit would provide
them with a real shelter. He was working
with a rifle when Ralph climbed in beside
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Motor O.K.?” Tim asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph nodded and tucked long legs underneath
as he sat down. He watched Tim work
over the rifle for several minutes before he
spoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the use of taking all that stuff?”
He pointed to the rifle, the pile of soft-nosed
bullets beside it, the snowshoes, the axe and
other equipment fastened to the walls of the
cockpit. “If we come down out there,” and he
pointed toward the bleak stretches of the
Arctic, “it’s curtains for us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph wasn’t trying to hang crepe. He was
simply stating the situation as he saw it,
tinged with an airman’s sense of fatality.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim kept on with his work; he knew Ralph
well. When he did answer, it was with carefully
chosen words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simply this, Ralph, if we come down out
there we’ve still got a good chance of coming
through. With snowshoes, this concentrated
food, plenty of warm clothing, plus a good
rifle and lots of ammunition, we can live for
months. Not scared, are you?” The last words
were whipped out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scared? Me?” Ralph’s question was one
of amazement. “I’m not scared and you know
it but a 2,200 mile flight over the jumping off
place isn’t the nicest thing in the world. But
I’m here and I’m going through with it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim, laughing at his friend’s evident indignation,
turned to him. “I know you are,
Ralph, and we’ll come out on top in the end.
Now get out of here and let me stow this stuff
away. If the weather is favorable, we’ll hop
off as soon as we can get some sleep.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Twelve hours later every inhabitant of
Point Barrow was down on the ice pack
watching the flyers’ final preparations. A
final inspection, a roar of the motor, and
Ralph flirted the tail of the plane around. The
motor, on full, drove a cloud of snow and ice
into the faces of the little cluster of Eskimos
and radio operators, and the monoplane
bumped over the ice. It gained speed slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inside the little cabin Tim and Ralph were
straining forward, fairly throwing their
energy into the roar of the motor and praying
that they would gain air speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The skis on the under carriage finally left
the rough ice; wobbled in the air for a moment,
looking as though they were on the feet
of a drunken man, and then plunked to the
ice. The plane careened and Tim and Ralph
were hurled against the sides of the cabin
with sickening thuds as a ski crumpled under
the shock and one wing drooped low, almost
scraping the ice. Ralph his hands clinging to
the controls, was fighting the plane in an
attempt to check its speed before any damage
could be done.</p>

<p class='c008'>He finally nosed it up an easy incline of
snow and the flyers hopped out to inspect the
damage. A minute later they were surrounded
by their Eskimo friends. One of the metal
skis was damaged beyond repair, and Tim
thanked heaven he had had the foresight to
put an extra pair in the plane before they
left Fairbanks. With the Eskimos to keep the
wing on the damaged side from dragging,
Ralph got his ship turned around and back at
the edge of the ice pack. Their first attempt
had failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Working feverishly in an effort to replace
the damaged ski and to take advantage of
the good weather, Tim and Ralph labored on
the plane, the numbing cold forcing them to
stop at short intervals to warm their chilled
hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Four hours later they were ready for the
second attempt. With the Eskimos cheering as
loudly as before, they started over the uneven
ice pack. The plane bumped and swayed as
it gained speed, calling for all the mastery in
the capable hands of Ralph, but it was going
faster than on the first attempt. It looked like
a sure thing this time, and both young adventurers
were congratulating themselves when
one ski struck a hummock, the rapidly moving
ship swung off its course and before Ralph
could right it, dove over a snow bank and
headed at right angles to its intended course.
By quick work they cut the motor and stopped
the plane before it had rammed its nose into
a snowbank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim grinned a little ruefully as he looked at
Ralph. Two attempts had failed and just when
conditions were ideal for their success.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll get this ship off the ice or bust in the
attempt!” Ralph had sensed the question in
his friend’s mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plane had not been damaged and with
the help of the willing Eskimos, they pulled
it out of the soft snow. It was evident to both
Tim and Ralph that it would be impossible to
make a take off from the rough ice pack near
Point Barrow. Further out on the pack, the
ice was smoother and three miles from the
village they found a suitable stretch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another day was spent in dragging the
plane over the ice and clearing away the rough
spots on their new field. But when they had
finished, they had a smooth runway more than
half a mile in length and wide enough for a
good margin of safety. A smashup now would
mean failure for the year since a new plane
could not be secured in time for another attempt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim and Ralph planned to snatch a few
hours sleep and then take off, for day and
night were one in the Arctic summer.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had hardly dropped asleep when an
operator from the radio station awakened
them with the news that a severe storm was
reported sweeping down the coast. The adventurers
hastily donned their clothes and
hurried across the pack where they covered
the plane with heavy tarpaulins and staked
them down. Tim was loath to desert his ship,
but the song of the chill blasts that were
sweeping over the ice warned them that it
would mean sure death to remain on the windswept
pack. After reassuring themselves that
they had done everything possible to protect
the plane, they started back for Point Barrow
on a run.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cry of the storm was louder, and far in
the west the sky was gray with sweeping
snow clouds. The flyers struggled on; Point
Barrow was less than half a mile away. Then
dense curtains of snow swirled about them
and Point Barrow might have been a million
miles away. The cold was intense; the snow
blinding, but arm in arm they staggered on,
trying to keep at right angles to the blasts.
Ralph was rapidly becoming numb for he
had donned only comparatively light clothes
when they had started their dash to the plane.
Now his feet were dragging and his body
chilled to the bone. He was half dazed, too,
with the desperateness of their situation.
With the village perhaps only a few feet
away, the wall of snow shut them in as effectively
as though they were in another world.
Ralph’s feet refused to move and he dropped
to the ice, exhausted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim slapped his companion’s face, beat his
arms and legs, but the aviator’s mind refused
to respond and he lay helpless. Struggling
with his friend, Tim finally managed to swing
his body over his shoulders and he staggered
slowly on through the swirling snow. His
double burden was sapping his strength and
his feet were like lead. The end was near. He
could hardly put one foot ahead of another.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One-two, one-two, one-two.” Slowly his
feet obeyed the command, then refused, and
he pitched forward, pinned to the ice by
Ralph’s body.</p>

<p class='c008'>They might have been centuries on the ice
for all Tim and Ralph knew, but when they
came to, they were in the radio station, clothing
off and their bodies undergoing snow
massages. Neither one had suffered much
from the effects of the experience although the
Eskimos had found them just in time. Nervous
exhaustion more than anything else had
been responsible for their collapse on the ice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wind and snow raged for three days,
and during that time Tim and Ralph spent
their hours in sleep and stowing away plenty
of good food, for the experience in the storm
had warned them that they must have their
bodies as well as their minds on edge if they
hoped to succeed on their flight over the top
of the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the fourth day the skies had cleared,
although the cold was intense. As soon as
they could get into their clothes, Tim and
Ralph headed a party across the ice, anxious
to discover what damage the storm might have
done to the plane. The tarpaulin-covered ship
looked like a model T snow house but when
they had removed the snow and the heavy
canvas covering, they found the plane intact.
The strong wind had swept snow clear of
their runway and after warming up the motor
and giving it a final test, they were ready for
another attempt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eskimos were dispatched to the village to
bring compasses and extra clothing while Tim
and Ralph satisfied themselves that the plane
was in perfect condition. When the party
from Point Barrow returned, they brought
two messages from the radio station. One was
that weather conditions were as near perfect
as possible and that the storm which had
raged for three days had passed down into the
Hudson Bay country.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other message was from their managing
editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eyes of the entire world on your daring
attempt. Our every wish for your success.—Carson.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The message cheered both flyers for they
well knew the dangers they were about to
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim installed the compasses, unrolled his
charts and checked them again while Ralph
idled the motor and then ran it up and down
the scale with never a miss.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were ready. The Eskimos jerked the
chocks out from under the skis, and the trim
little monoplane shot down the smooth runway,
bound on one of the most daring flights
in the history of aviation!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c009'>CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The plane skimmed over the ice for nearly
half a mile, then shot upward in a joyous
goodbye to the little group on the ice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim and Ralph smiled at each other. At
last they were off the ice, in the air, and
started on the 2,200 mile flight over the roof
of the world—a flight that was to carry them
across the heart of the Arctic, across areas
never before seen by the eyes of man. Just
what the hours ahead of them held in store
they could only guess. Tim hoped that the
trip would reveal the age-old secret of the
Arctic, whether a hidden continent existed in
the land of ice and snow. Ralph hoped that
the plane would carry them through to King’s
Bay, Spitzbergen, their destination.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pilot kept the stick back until they
reached 6,000 feet and then leveled off on
their course. The motor was running
smoothly, even though the thermometer outside
the cockpit windows registered 40 degrees
below zero. Underneath them, their
shadow was flitting over the rough, broken
ice pack at 110 miles an hour. For two hours
they roared steadily onward, with only an
occasional word, Ralph handling the stick and
Tim carefully checking their course, for a
variation of one degree would make them
miss Spitzbergen, scarcely more than a tiny
dot of an island on the other end of their long
course.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were far out on the Arctic ice pack
and Tim kept a careful check of his charts
while he scanned the rolling sea of ice beneath
them for traces of the fabled Arctic continent.
At 6,000 feet they had a visibility of 200 miles
and he secured some marvelous pictures. For
another two hours they forged steadily ahead,
conversation at a minimum, although Ralph
chewed enthusiastically on a cud of gum.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim estimated that they were nearly 500
miles from Point Barrow when they sighted
storm clouds far ahead. Great, rolling banks
of clouds were piling up over the horizon as
the speedy little plane roared on its eastward
flight. The air was growing colder and Ralph
revved the motor up in an attempt to climb
above the approaching storm, but fast though
the sleek, gray monoplane climbed, the clouds
climbed faster, and, finally, with a shrug of
his shoulders that meant more than words,
Ralph glanced at his chart and compasses and
headed into the storm. Snow and wind buffeted
them and the compasses swung wildly
as the plane gyrated in the air. For half an
hour Ralph fought the controls, a half hour
that was centuries long to Tim, who had
staked everything on the success of their
flight. The clouds thinned and they shot out
again into clear weather. The storm had
swung them nearly 50 miles further south
than they had intended, and Ralph turned the
plane northward again. Although they were
cutting across the heart of the Arctic, they
would not pass over the North Pole, since
the only purpose of the flight was to discover
whether there was hitherto unknown land in
the Arctic.</p>

<p class='c008'>For hours they droned onward, both young
adventurers busy at their tasks. Mile after
mile of ice, some of it smooth as glass, other
stretches rough and hummocked and sometimes
shot with long streaks of open water,
unfolded under their eyes. They were flying
very high, up nearly 10,000 feet, and the
visibility was unusually good. But still there
was no land. Only ice and water and more
ice. Tim snapped magnificent panoramas of
ice and snow that would thrill thousands of
newspaper readers if they succeeded.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cold was bitter but with the motor
functioning perfectly neither Tim nor Ralph
noticed it. Once in a while they shifted positions
to rest their tensed bodies and their
conversation was in shouted monosyllables.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly Tim’s elbow went into Ralph’s
ribs and one heavily gloved hand pointed to
the hazy outlines of land far to their right.
Ralph nodded and grinned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s Grant land,” shouted Tim. “Means
we’ve passed over the heart of the Arctic
without finding land. The big job’s done.
Now all we’ve got to do is keep on until we
reach Spitzbergen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had flown over the top of the world
and definitely proved that the fabled Arctic
continent was just that—a fable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The northern end of Grant land rapidly assumed
definite proportions while Tim completed
his log of their flight over the heart of
the Arctic.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was more open water below them
now and the lines on Ralph’s face deepened,
for a forced landing would mean sure disaster.
Grant land slipped away beneath them
as they pushed steadily eastward while far
to the south the mountains of Greenland were
rearing their white-crested heads.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim went back in the cabin to check up on
their gasoline supply, for they were still
nearly 600 miles from Spitzbergen. He had
just completed testing the tanks when a shout
from Ralph made him hurry back to the pilot.
There was no need for words. Far ahead,
probably 300 miles away, another storm was
brewing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim debated only a moment before he
turned to his pilot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s up to you, Ralph,” he yelled in his
companion’s ear. “We can buck the storm or
turn back and land at Grant land. Plenty of
game there to keep us alive and if we can’t
get the plane off the ice again, we can walk
to the station of the Northwest Mounted
Police at Bache peninsula.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not going to do any walking in this
temperature,” shouted Ralph. “It’s Spitzbergen
or curtains for me,” and he turned back
to his controls.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next two hours were an agony of suspense
for Tim and Ralph. Ahead of them
the storm clouds loomed higher and higher
and half an hour before they reached the
storm area, the wind was teasing their plane.
But there was no turning around now; only
straight ahead for their gas was too low to
risk a flight back to Grant land.</p>

<p class='c008'>Into the heart of the storm they flew; both
white faced and tense as they faced the final
ordeal of their great flight. The gale tossed
their plane through the clouds and driving
snow beat on the wings and against the windows
of the cabin. Both men were watching
the clock on the instrument board, with Tim
making anxious trips to the gas tanks. Their
fuel supply was running dangerously low.</p>

<p class='c008'>If only the storm would abate so they
could get their bearings. The same prayer was
in the minds of both and whether it was an
answer or flyer’s luck, the clouds lightened a
few minutes later and during a lull in the
storm, Ralph sent the plane rocketing downward.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the 1,000 foot level he checked their descent
and through the now thinly drifting
snow they could discern a savage, broken line
of cliffs rearing their heads above the ice pack.
Further back were the outlines of a mountain
range.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spitzbergen. Tim let out a shout of relief
and Ralph gave the motor the gun in an attempt
to find a suitable landing place before
the storm closed down again. They shot low
over the coast line, but the clouds cut down
their visibility and it was impossible to see
more than a mile in any direction. Ahead of
them the mountains disappeared in the clouds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph circled desperately, motor thrumming
wildly. Finally he found a small, level
snow field, well down in an ice valley. It was
risky but with the storm and the gas supply
nearly exhausted, a landing was the only
thing. The pilot banked swiftly, cut his motor,
straightened out and then drifted down on
the narrow field. The skis touched the frozen
snow, bounced once, twice, and then carried
them smoothly forward. The plane stopped
under one wing of the little valley, well protected
from the storm, which was closing
down again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Half paralyzed with cold and fatigue, Tim
and Ralph forced themselves out of the plane.
Hastily, they examined the ship, then dove
into the cabin for an axe, light steel stakes
and ropes. In a short time they had the plane
staked down securely and had slipped the
heavy canvas cover of the heater over the
motor. A portion of their precious fuel went
to fill the tank of the heater for if the oil in
the motor froze their chances of getting into
the air again would vanish.</p>

<p class='c008'>Back in the cabin of the plane they warmed
themselves over their alcohol stoves while
outside the wind and snow raged at the man-made
craft which had slipped through their
fingers. Tim opened their supply kit and they
munched chocolate and biscuits and topped it
off with malted milks made from melted ice.
There had been little conversation, but now
that the strain of the long flight was over
and they were on land again, their lips were
unsealed and they discussed the trips and
their prospects at some length.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Storm sounds like a regular old norther
and that may mean a week,” was one of
Ralph’s laconic contributions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not worrying as much about the storm
as I am about our gas supply,” said Tim.
“We’ve got enough concentrated food for a
couple of weeks but we may not have enough
gas to get us any place when it does let up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m too tired to worry about where we
are, gas, food or anything else,” and with that
Ralph snuggled down in his flying clothes and
was soon asleep. Tim adjusted the little stoves,
made sure that there was proper ventilation
in the cabin, and was in a sleep of exhaustion
in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>How long they slept neither one knew for
when they awoke the clock on the instrument
board had stopped, but the storm continued
in full strength. The temperature was flirting
with the 30 degree below zero mark but
in the enclosed cabin they were comfortable.
Despite the intense cold and the angry shrieks
of the gale, Ralph insisted on dodging out to
give the plane a “once over.” With an inward
feeling of unrest, Tim watched his companion
disappear in the storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Seconds were minutes and minutes were
hours while Tim waited for Ralph to return.
He was on the verge of despair when his chum
stumbled through the swirling snow and
pitched headlong onto the floor of the plane.
Ralph was shouting and laughing idiotically.
Something in his mind had snapped under the
terrific strain of the flight and the pounding
of the storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although Ralph continued to shout and
once in a while screamed in terror, Tim
realized that he was not dangerous and that the
trouble was probably a nervous one. He fixed
a cup of hot chocolate and the steaming liquid
calmed Ralph. Words and phrases became
coherent and Tim was astounded by the story
he pieced together from his friend’s rambling
account.</p>

<p class='c008'>He couldn’t doubt Ralph’s story—there
must be something behind his incoherent narrative—something
in the tale of terror that
had driven him half mad. But Tim felt that
the big thing was to get Ralph calm, to give
his nervous system a chance to get back to
normal.</p>

<p class='c008'>For endless hours he sat with Ralph, soothing
him as some shriek of the gale alarmed
him. In spite of himself, Tim half expected
some unknown terror to stalk out of the
storm. Could he, too, be losing his senses? He
pinched himself and tried to reason that
everything was all right but back of all the
common sense he could call upon was the fact
that Ralph had encountered something far
beyond the ordinary. Whatever it was, Tim
intended to find out as soon as the storm let
up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph finally sank into a deep sleep of
nervous exhaustion and a short time later the
storm abated. The wind died down rapidly
and the snow ceased its stinging tattoo against
the plane. In the gray light Tim could see the
dim outlines of the ice walls of the valley
which had shielded them from the full fury of
the elements.</p>

<p class='c008'>With Ralph asleep it was his chance to do a
little exploring, and, making sure that he was
ready for action, Tim slipped out of the cabin.
He knew that whatever had terrorized Ralph
must be close for the flyer couldn’t have
wandered far in the storm and found his way
back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim skirted the right side of the valley and
was halfway back on the left side when he
came upon a good-sized opening in the ice wall
of the valley. For a moment he hesitated.
Without doubt it was something behind the
black opening which had so upset Ralph. Determined
to solve the mystery, Tim looked at
his rifle again, then started resolutely forward.
Half a dozen paces inside the mouth of
the cave he halted. There was no sound of
life—nothing to indicate that some Arctic
animal might be waiting to pounce upon him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ahead Tim thought the darkness of the
cave seemed lighter and he pushed cautiously
on, testing every foot of the way for fear he
might step in some fissure in the ice. The cave
was growing lighter. He turned a corner and
stopped involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c008'>In spite of himself Tim exclaimed aloud at
the horror and beauty of the scene that was
unfolded before his eyes. Vikings—great
giants of men—peered down at him from the
prow of their galley, spears in hand, ready to
impale him if he moved.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a minute Tim was motionless. Then
he realized that somehow, in centuries long
gone, a Viking ship and crew had been
caught by the relentless north and entombed
by the ice. There they had been for centuries
and there they might remain keeping their
ceaseless vigil, until the end of time, unless
Tim carried the news of his discovery back
with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>No wonder Ralph had been terrorized when
he stumbled into the ice tomb. Light that
filtered through crevices in the roof gave a
weird, unnatural effect that would have
shocked the nerves of even the steadiest man.
And Ralph had already been under a terrific
strain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim stood reverently before the tomb of the
men of old. It was evidently the forward
watch looking down at him for the prow of
the vessel was all that was in view. The rest
of the strange craft faded into the shadows
of the ice wall of the cave.</p>

<p class='c008'>The men were physical giants—their crude
leather jackets still buttoned close around
them to keep out the Arctic cold. Yellow hair
peeped from beneath helmets that fitted close
to their heads. Long spears were clutched in
readiness for a foe that never came and eyes
stared over Tim and into eternity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim spent an hour studying his discovery
and mentally cataloging all the details. What
stories he would have when they got back
to civilization. In addition to proving that
there was no continent in the Arctic, they
had found a tomb of the Vikings.</p>

<p class='c008'>He hastily ran back for his camera and
exhausted the remainder of his supply of
plates taking time exposures in the tomb of
the north.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim knew that if they could safely complete
their flight, they would have some of the
greatest news pictures in years.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he finally returned to the plane he
resolved to say nothing about his discovery
to Ralph when his chum awoke, rested and
with his nerves back to normal, Tim was
happy to see that his pilot recalled the whole
incident as a bad dream. Later he would tell
him all about it.</p>

<p class='c008'>While Ralph took off the hood of the heater
and inspected the motor, Tim busied himself
working out their location.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not as bad as it might be, Ralph,” he
called. “I’ve got it doped out we’re on an island
just off the west coast of Spitzbergen.
King’s bay is about 100 miles, air line, and
we’ve got enough gas to make it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Plenty of gas, if we ever get off this excuse
for a landing field,” grunted Ralph. He
scrambled into the cabin, threw the switches,
and Tim swung the propeller. Again and
again he leaned on the shiny stick and finally
the motor caught with a sputter, then a roar
that shrouded the plane in a cloud of snow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim hastily chopped away the lashings and
helped Ralph swing the plane around so it
headed toward the coast. Down the center
of the valley the wind had swept the snow
clean and hard, ideal for a takeoff if there
was room enough to get the plane into the air
before it crashed into the ice on the shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph gave the motor a final test and motioned
for Tim to climb in. The song of the
motor deepened, reached a crescendo, and
they started slowly ahead, gathering speed
rapidly, and, just when it seemed that they
would catapult into the ice, they shot into the
air. It was an old trick and Ralph had worked
it to perfection.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the motor working perfectly despite
their enforced stay in the valley, they headed
eastward and in little more than an hour were
skimming over King’s Bay.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they landed, both adventurers tumbled
from their plane and raced for the radio
station where they made arrangements with
the operator to send their stories to the News
as fast as they could be written.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph wrote the story of their flight over
the top of the world and failure to discover
land while Tim wove his discovery of the Viking
tomb into a powerful, dramatic tale that
within a few hours was to fascinate the reading
public of America.</p>

<p class='c008'>The operator was still busy sending their
copy over the ether waves when he stopped
for a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a couple of messages for you,” he
said to Tim. “Shall I take them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go ahead,” replied the flying reporter.</p>

<p class='c008'>The operator’s fingers flew as he copied the
messages and then handed them to Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter’s eyes dimmed and his
hands shook as he read the first message,
then re-read it to be sure that he was not
mistaken.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Tim’s heart leaped with joy. Aviation editor
of the News! The attainment of his cherished
goal.</p>

<p class='c008'>With trembling fingers he took up the
second sheet of flimsy. The words danced before
his eyes; they were almost like a message
from another world.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Congratulations. Your flight was splendid.
Am awaiting your return. No fun sky-larking

<div class='c013'>THE SKY HAWK.”</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c009'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Tim kept the contents of the Sky Hawk’s
message to himself. There was no need to
alarm Ralph for he felt that it was a personal
matter, but it disturbed him more than he
cared to acknowledge. On the verge of what
should have been his greatest success, the attainment
of the goal to which he had been
striving, the aviation editorship of the News,
had come the mysterious message from the
Sky Hawk, and Tim promised himself that
he would keep himself fully prepared and
alive to every emergency.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their return to Atkinson brought a round
of banquets and series of speeches at civic
clubs. By early fall he was back in the pleasant
routine, but this time with a desk of his own
and the sign, “Aviation Editor,” on a small
card.</p>

<p class='c008'>For days he watched the news, listened to
the gossip at the airport but there was no
sign of the Sky Hawk—no sign since the day
he had looted the wreck of the mail months before
in the fastnesses of the Great Smokies.
Yet Tim felt that the Sky Hawk was about
to strike again and he knew that the next
time it would be a battle to the end.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the smouldering fires of revolt burst
into flame in Mexico. General Enrique Lopez,
an officer in the federal army, had broken with
the government and had taken the field
against the federals. His army, recruited from
the ranks of disgruntled federal soldiers,
Yaqui Indians and peasants, enjoyed startling
success in the first days of the revolution.
Then Lopez played his hidden card and
bombed Mexico City from the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The daring of his feat fanned American
interest in the revolt and the front pages of
the papers blazed with headlines which told
of the progress of the revolt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Young airmen, attracted by the high salaries
offered by both the federal and rebel
armies, flocked toward the border, only to be
met by the stern, hard flying men of the U.S.
army’s border patrol. There they were warned
to turn back or take their chances at being
shot down in their attempt to fly into Mexico.
The majority of them returned but a few of
the more daring ran the gauntlet of fire from
the border patrol and made their way into
Mexico.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few pictures of the fighting between the
troops came straggling up from the border
but they were far from satisfactory and so
far as could be ascertained, there were no
actual photographs of the rebel chieftain.
Within a short time American news picture
services were offering fabulous prices for
pictures of General Lopez but the wily rebel
leader evaded every effort of the photographers.
The luckless individuals who penetrated
through his lines were imprisoned and
their plates and cameras smashed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim, who had been watching the course of
events below the border, was not greatly surprised
when, one morning late in August,
Carson called him to his desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you be ready to start for Mexico in
half an hour?” asked the managing editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had halfway expected to be sent to
the border but to be asked to get into the interior
of the strife-torn country was another
thing. But his answer was quick in coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In less than that, if it’s necessary,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not ordering you to go, Tim,” went on
the managing editor. “It’s up to you, but it’s
a great chance for the News to scoop the
world if you can get inside Lopez’ lines, gain
his confidence, and get back here with exclusive
pictures of the rebel camp. It will be
dangerous and your life will be in your own
hands.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll be ready to start in half an hour,” was
Tim’s even-toned reply. Inwardly he was
seething with excitement for it was his biggest
assignment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was fairly sure you would go,” smiled
Carson, “but I don’t want you to take an unnecessary
risk. I’ve had your equipment ordered,
a high speed camera, and plenty of
plates for the long distance shots. In addition,
we have a small pocket camera that may come
in handy if they seize your big machine.
Here’s plenty of money for expenses on the
first part of the trip and we’ll authorize the
bank at Nogales, Arizona, to honor your
checks for any amounts that you may need.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had turned away from the managing
editor’s desk to tell Dan Watkins of his big
assignment when Carson called him back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think you ought to know,” he said, “that
if you get those pictures we can sell the national
rights on them to a news picture service.
That will mean several thousand dollars
and I’ll see that you get a fair share if you
succeed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dan, at the copy desk, was enthusiastic,
but he cautioned Tim to be careful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll miss you, Tim, and will be looking
for your return,” he added as they said goodbye.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim hurried to his room, gathered the few
essentials he would need for the trip, and
drove out to the field. There he inspected the
cameras and made sure that everything was
in readiness for the long flight. It would be a
good 1,000 miles to Nogales, on the border,
and another 200 miles down into the mountains
of Sonora before Tim could hope to
come in contact with the rebel forces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Confident that he had all the equipment necessary
for his hazardous undertaking, Tim
swung into the cockpit of the Good News. The
motor was purring impatiently, as though
the plane sensed its mission and was anxious
to be clear of the ties that kept it earth-bound.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were hasty last-minute farewells and
then Tim sent his plane dusting over the field
and into the air. He was away on his biggest
assignment—that of securing pictures of the
leader of the Mexican revolt.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trip to Nogales was uneventful and
Tim took two days to cover the 1,000 miles,
landing at the border city shortly before noon
on the second day. He circled over the airport
while one of the ships of the U. S. army
border patrol took off and climbed to have a
look at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the pilot of the army craft saw the
sign on Tim’s plane, he waved a friendly
greeting and sped away into the east on his
lonely patrol.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim soared down out of the cloudless sky
and brought the Good News to a stop on the
brown, sunbaked field at the edge of the city.
He went through the usual formality of registering
his plane and his credentials were
accepted without question.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before he left the field to run into the city
for lunch, an incoming plane attracted his
attention. It was one of the border patrolmen,
flying fast and low. The machine made a dizzy
sideslip and broke one wheel in landing but
the pilot managed to check its wild course and
brought it to a halt before it crashed into one
of the hangars near the main office.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was one of the first to reach the plane
and helped pull a white-faced flyer from the
cockpit. The army man had been shot through
the right shoulder and his arm hung limp and
useless. He had managed, somehow, to land
with only one hand on the controls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened, Kennard,” demanded
Captain John Talbot, commandant of the
Nogales field.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ran into a chap trying to cross the
border,” replied Lieutenant Ned Kennard,
“and he decided to shoot it out with me.
You’ll find what’s left of him about twenty-five
miles west of here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim pieced the story together and secured
enough material for a dandy yarn on the first
airplane battle along the border. He hastened
into town to the telegraph office where he filed
a 1,000 word story to the News. When he
returned to the field after lunch he found a
message from Carson, congratulating him on
the story. Tim’s yarn had been much more
complete than the story carried on the press
association wires and had reached Carson’s
desk two hours before it came through the
regular channels. It had enabled the News to
score a clean beat on their rival afternoon
papers in Atkinson on the big story of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was forced to wait a few minutes
before he could obtain an interview with the
commandant of the field. When he finally
entered Captain Talbot’s office, he received
a cordial greeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand you want permission to cross
the border and hope to get pictures of Lopez
and his rebel camp,” said the commandant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” said Tim, “and I’ll appreciate
all the advice and help you can give me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then my advice is don’t go,” replied Captain
Talbot. “General Lopez is a thoroughly
capable military man but his chances of success
are slim. Even now he has been driven
into the mountains of Sonora and only his
air force of a dozen planes has saved him. He
may have to make a break for the international
border almost any day and he doesn’t
want his picture broadcast. As it is now, I
haven’t any idea what he looks like for we
have no photographs. But if you succeed in
your mission he will be recognized instantly
at any border post.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think the revolution Lopez has
started is justified?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I don’t,” said Captain Talbot, emphasizing
every word. “I’ve been on the border
for ten years now and I know Lopez is
nothing more than a bandit, and not a very high
class one at that. He’s using the revolution
as a guise to rob banks, loot towns and generally
blackmail all of the business interests
in the territory which he controls. It’s simply
banditry on a wholesale scale and when he gets
his pockets filled, he’ll slide across the border
and leave his subordinates to face the federal
firing squads.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nice sort of a fellow, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said the military man. “Nice when
you have him in front of you where you can
watch him every minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve been assigned to get pictures of Lopez
and that’s what I’m going to do,” said Tim.
“It looks like I may be helping a lot of poor
fellows if I do get those pictures and spread
Lopez’ likeness all over the front pages.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t envy you the task. You’re putting
your head in the lion’s mouth and you’ll be so
far down in Sonora that we won’t be able to
help you. If you were only ten or twelve miles
across the border, we might help for we
stretch the boundary once in a while when our
people get in trouble,” said Captain Talbot
while a slight smile played around the corners
of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I might as well make plans to start first
thing in the morning,” said Tim, “and if
you’ll lend me a bucket of dope, I’ll paint out
the sign on the side of my plane. It would be
fatal to go barging into Mexico with that kind
of an identification for everyone to shoot at.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Captain Talbot agreed to let Tim have all
the material he needed and also assigned a
mechanic to help him. By late afternoon the
Good News had been completely disguised
and some fake bullet holes, to indicate a clash
with the border patrol, were made in the
wings and the fuselage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had decided on the role he would play.
He intended to stake the success or failure of
his plan on a bold approach of Lopez’ camp,
where he would present himself as a free lance
flyer ready to join the rebel cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next morning Tim secured the latest
information on the whereabouts of the rebel
chieftain and found that Lopez was near
Cedros, three hundred miles south of the
border and well into the mountains of Sonora.
From that guarded retreat he was directing
his army while his flyers made raids on the
federal troops who were massing for an attack
on his mountain stronghold.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the good wishes of the border patrolmen
ringing in his ears, Tim took off from
the field at Nogales and headed south, following
the line of the Southern Pacific of Mexico.
For a hundred miles he followed this course,
then angled southeast. In a little more than
two hours and a half he was well into the
mountains, and according to his map, should
be nearing Cedros, the village where Lopez
had established his headquarters.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sharp droning caught Tim’s attention
and he turned to find a black monoplane bearing
down on him. Twin machine guns,
mounted on the cowling, were belching tracer
bullets in his direction. One thing sure, Lopez’
watchdogs of the clouds were on the alert.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had no intention of being shot down
and although he was confident the Good News
could outrun and out-maneuver the other
plane, he concluded he might just as well start
his little game. He gripped the stick between
his knees and held his hands above his head
as the other plane overhauled him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pilot of the black craft stopped his
chattering guns and motioned for Tim to
precede him through a gap in the mountains.
In less than five minutes they were over the
sheltered valley where the village of Cedros
nestled close to the mountain-side. It was an
ideal retreat for the rebel chieftain, practically
inaccessible to the federal troops and
easily defended from the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim, obeying orders from the other pilot,
landed in a small field a short distance from
the village. He shut off his motor and waited
for his captor to approach. The pilot of the
black monoplane was a chunky little man
with fiery red hair and watery blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you doing down here?” he demanded,
as he came up to Tim’s plane. He
carried a revolver strapped to his waist but
made no motion toward it. “You’re nothing
but a youngster,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m looking for General Lopez,” said Tim.
“I heard he was paying good money for
flyers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve found Lopez all right,” said the
other airman. “This is his headquarters and
unless I’m mistaken, he’s hot-footing it down
here right now. You’d better tell a straight
story or he’ll make you wish you were never
born.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim saw a pudgy, brown-skinned little man
in a khaki uniform with an abundance of gold
braid, strutting down the road that bordered
the field. Trailing him were half a dozen officers
of nondescript rank.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better climb down,” muttered Tim’s
captor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flying reporter slid out of his plane
and lounged against the fuselage, as he
watched the approach of the rebel leader. So
this pig-eye lump of a man was the leader of
the revolution. Tim felt a surge of disappointment
for Lopez was anything but what he
had pictured him. Tim had visualized a tall,
clean cut man with a forceful personality
and he felt cheated at what he saw.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the general approached, Tim’s captor
drew himself to attention and saluted. Tim
thought it might make a good impression if
he did likewise. His hunch was right for he
saw a flash of pleasure in the eyes of Lopez.</p>

<p class='c008'>The general wasted few words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is this man?” he demanded of the
other flyer. The pilot of the rebel plane told
how he had sighted Tim and brought him to
Cedros. He added that Tim had told him he
hoped to join the rebel air force.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lopez turned on Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So,” he said, “you wish to join us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are you and where do you come
from?” The words cracked through the air
like a whiplash and Tim was startled by the
forcefulness of the question but he had
planned carefully for just such a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m Tim Murphy of Blanton,” he replied,
“and out for anything that promises good
pay.” Tim had decided to use his own name
but not that of his home town.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lopez was appraising him through half-closed
eyes and Tim felt them boring into him,
searching for something false in his appearance.
Whatever the rebel chief’s shortcomings
might be, he was a man of decision.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can join us,” he said, “at $200 a week,
but one bad move and—.” Lopez did not complete
the sentence for a plane careened
through the gap in the mountains and settled
down swiftly on the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim, who was busy surveying his new surroundings,
paid little attention to the newcomer
until the pilot climbed out of his cockpit
and took off his helmet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he found himself staring into the
eyes of Daredevil Dugan!</p>

<p class='c008'>Before Tim had time to speak or motion
Dugan to silence, the daredevil was striding
toward him, hand outstretched.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How’s the flying reporter of the Atkinson
News?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim looked about him quickly. There
wasn’t a chance in the world for an escape.
He’d have to face the music and he wondered
if Dugan’s words had been intended to get
him into trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So!” the words hissed from Lopez’ lips,
“you’re a flying reporter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no use in denying and Tim felt
that he might have a better chance if he told
the truth. Without hesitation, he told who he
was and why he had invaded the stronghold
of the rebel chief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well, well,” drawled Lopez, “now
isn’t that nice of you to come down and see me.
I’ll be only too glad to pose for you. Suppose
you get your camera out and take some pictures.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim wondered what the rebel’s game was
but he obeyed the orders and snapped Lopez
in half a dozen different poses. The rebel
leader’s vanity irritated him and he would
like to have punched his stubby little nose but
that would only have spelled more trouble.
When Lopez was satisfied that enough pictures
had been taken, he turned accusing eyes
on Dugan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now Mr. Dugan,” he said in a half
whisper, “I thank you for telling me who this
man is. He’s not going back to the border
and neither are you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” cried the daredevil
“That you’re not going back to the border.
That’s plain isn’t it. Both of you know too
much now. Besides, I never fully trusted you
Dugan and this is a good excuse to put you
out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t get away with that,” cried Dugan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I can’t? Well, who’s to stop me?”
There seemed to be no immediate answer to
that question and Tim and Dugan proceeded
down the road in the direction of the village,
two dirty little soldiers with drawn bayonets
at their heels.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they reached the plaza at Cedros,
General Lopez ordered them thrown into the
village jail, a filthy one-room structure with
high, barred windows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might have given me a break, Dugan,”
said Tim when the door had clanged
shut on them. “There wasn’t any special reason
for your shouting my name all over the
countryside, was there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m mighty sorry about that, Tim,” replied
the daredevil and there was a convincing
ring of sincerity to his words, “I was
surprised to see you and didn’t realize what I
was saying.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think Lopez will keep us here
long?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think? I don’t have to think. After what
he said back there at the field, it may be curtains
for us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He wouldn’t dare put us out of the way
for good,” protested Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he would,” replied the daredevil.
“Lopez is in a desperate situation. If you took
those pictures back to the border he would be
instantly recognized when he tried to make his
getaway. He’ll go to any end to keep his pictures
from being broadcast all over the
U. S. A., and especially along the border.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just what Captain Talbot of the
border patrol at Nogales told me,” said Tim.
“He advised me not to make the trip down
here and it commences to look like he was
right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Talbot’s got some fine flyers,” said Dugan
dryly. “One of them chased me for fifteen
minutes when I crossed the border and shot
my wings so full of holes I thought I was flying
in a sieve.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Their conversation was interrupted when
the door swung open and an officer ordered
them to follow him. They were escorted
across the plaza to the only hotel in the village,
a straggling adobe structure where the rebel
chieftain made his headquarters.</p>

<p class='c008'>General Lopez wasted no words when they
faced him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My council of war,” he began as he
pointed to a half dozen grinning officers at
his side, “has decided that you are dangerous
to our cause. This man,” and he pointed at
Tim, “has made a deliberate attempt to jeopardize
my own life, while you,” and he
snapped the words at Dugan, “know too much
for your own good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The revolutionary leader paused for a
moment to give weight to his next words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Therefore,” he said slowly, enjoying
every moment of the little drama in which he
was the chief character, “the council has decreed
that you shall die at sunrise tomorrow.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c009'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Tim, raging at the injustice of the whole
thing, leaped, forward, his fists clenched, but
Dugan caught his arms and whispered in his
ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Easy, Tim, easy. You’ll only get a knife
in your ribs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim could see the truth in Dugan’s words
and allowed himself to be led back to the stinking
little building which was dignified by the
word “prison.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t there any way we can get word to
the American authorities?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid not,” replied the daredevil.
“Once a fellow comes below the border he’s
pretty much on his own and it’s up to us to
get out of here before daylight tomorrow.
It won’t be long before dark and then we’ll
see what can be done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim, restless and angered by the events
which had just taken place, paced about the
room, testing the bars at the windows and
kicking the dobe walls in an attempt to find
some weakness. The idea of facing a firing
squad in the morning did not strike him as
especially alarming for he had confidence that
in some way he and the daredevil would be
able to make their escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shadows of evening were already filling
the plaza when Dugan went to a window
and raised a shout for food. A guard ordered
him to be silent, but he only increased his
clamor until his cries attracted the attention
of General Lopez, who was taking his evening
stroll on the far side of the square.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Provide them with food,” ordered the
rebel leader, “and see to it that it is a good
meal for it will be their last.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The guard muttered under his breath but
hastened away to carry out the command.</p>

<p class='c008'>On one of his restless rounds of the room
Tim’s foot struck something half imbedded in
the floor. He managed to pull the object free
and found himself the possessor of a piece of
iron pipe about eighteen inches long.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, Dugan,” he exclaimed, “we
ought to be able to dispose of Mr. Guard with
this when he comes with our food.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give it to me,” said the daredevil, “I
want just one whack at that fellow’s head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not on your life,” replied Tim. “I found
the pipe and I’m perfectly capable of using
it. You’ll have your hands full if another
guard happens along with this chap.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The guard could be heard returning and
Tim took his place behind the door. His heart
beat a trifle faster and he took a fresh grip
on the pipe. He heard Dugan move closer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s two of them,” whispered the
daredevil. “Let them both get inside and then
use that pipe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim heard one of the guards fumbling with
the heavy lock, then the rattle of the chain,
and finally the squeak of the rusty hinges as
the door was swung open. The rays from a
smoky kerosene lantern made a half-hearted
attempt to pierce the gloom of their prison
and the guard carrying the basket of food
stepped into the room, followed by the man
with the lantern. Before the rebels had a
chance to get their eyes accustomed to the
gloom, Tim leaped from his hiding place, his
arm flashing in a quick blow that felled the
man with the lantern before he could utter a
cry of warning. Dugan caught the lantern as
it dropped from the fingers of the unconscious
soldier and Tim lunged ahead, bent on completing
his task.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man with the basket of food half
turned. He saw Tim’s upraised arm but was
powerless to evade the blow. His cry of alarm
was cut short and he fell limp into Tim’s arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole thing had taken less than five
seconds for Tim’s two blows had been fast
and true.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you crack their heads?” asked Dugan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” snapped Tim. “They’ll be all right
in a few minutes. We’d better get out of here
and head for our planes. When they come to
or are missed, this hotbed of rebels will be
at our heels.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Grab a blanket and sombrero from one
of those chaps,” said Dugan. “It will help us
in getting out of the village.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim threw a blanket over his shoulders
and pulled one of the high-crowned hats far
down over his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, let’s go. You lead the way,
Dugan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The daredevil stepped outside their jail,
pulled the door shut, rattled the chain, and
then blew out the lantern. “Just in case anyone
might be looking,” he whispered to Tim.
They melted into the shadows, and hurried in
the direction of the field which served as headquarters
for the rebel air force.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reached the field unmolested and discarded
their blankets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better take my plane,” suggested Tim.
“It’s fast and there’s plenty of gas to get us
to the border.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suits me,” said Dugan. “The quicker we
get away from here the better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim climbed into the cockpit and his legs
struck something boxlike as he swung into his
seat. His groping hands discovered his
camera. He could hardly repress a shout for
there was his machine loaded with the pictures
for which Lopez had so arrogantly
posed in the afternoon. Tim recalled having
seen an officer drop the camera back into the
cockpit of his plane. What rare luck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim placed the heavy camera under his
seat and turned on the light over his instrument
board for a moment to be sure that the
delicate gauges and his compass had not been
tampered. Satisfied that everything was all
right, he called down to Dugan to hop aboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In just a minute, Tim,” said the daredevil.
“There are a couple of planes here and
Lopez may send them out after us when he
realizes we have escaped. It will be moonlight
in a few minutes and we don’t want to take
any chances of being overhauled and shot
down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He slipped away and a moment later Tim
heard the sound of a heavy blow and splintering
of wood. In a few seconds the sound was
repeated and then Dugan appeared beside the
Good News chuckling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Neither one of those ships will get into
the air tonight,” he said. “I found a heavy
club and smashed their props.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dugan took his place in the forward cockpit
and Tim bent down to turn on the starter.
Just then he heard shouts and cries of alarm
from the village and lanterns flashed in the
trees that separated the field from Lopez’
headquarters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get going, Tim, get going,” urged Dugan.
“They’ve found out we’ve escaped. You’ve
got about a thousand feet of level ground
ahead. Then you’ll have to lift her fast to
clear the trees.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim turned on the starter and it whirred
for what seemed an age while the dancing
lanterns came closer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally the motor caught and burst into a
roar that reverberated down the valley. There
was no time to warm up the engine and Tim
opened his throttle and sped his plane down
the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>Faster and faster they raced while behind
them the night was punctuated with crimson
stabs of rifle fire as the rebels sent volley after
volley crashing in pursuit of the fleeing plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>The motor never faltered and when the
trees loomed ahead Tim had plenty of flying
speed. He zoomed the Good News into the
night sky and turned on his instrument light
to get his bearings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ahead of him he could discern the gap in
the mountains and he roared through it with
his exhaust belching streams of flame.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim set his course for Nogales, north by
west and settled down for three hours of
flying. By the time the moon came up, Sonora
was far to their rear and a few minutes after
midnight they circled the field at Nogales. The
sound of their motor awakened the field crew
and landing lights were turned on.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim brought the Good News to a
stop, he was greeted by Captain Talbot, who
had thrown a coat on over his pajamas.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Back already?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Back and with half a dozen pictures posed
by General Lopez,” grinned Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What!” exclaimed the army man, who
could hardly believe what he had heard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim pulled his camera out from under his
seat. “Right here,” he said, “are half a dozen
of first class pictures of Lopez. Let’s go into
the office,” he added, “and I’ll tell you all
about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Captain Talbot was almost incredulous
when he heard Tim’s story but the plates were
absolute proof of his tale.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll leave one of the plates with you for
your border patrol bulletin,” said Tim, “but
the pictures must be kept in strict confidence.
Now if I can get some gas I think we’ll hop
along toward Atkinson. If we can get away
from here at 1 o’clock we ought to make it
there by noon tomorrow, figuring on one more
stop for gas and oil.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dugan going to help you pilot on the way
home?” asked Captain Talbot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Tim, “and I’ll need the help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I expect you will. I ought to hold Dugan
here under arrest but I guess he’s learned his
lesson and won’t go hunting for any more
revolutions. How about it Dugan?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re right, Captain Talbot. No more
revolutions for mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I can borrow a control stick for the
front cockpit it will help out a lot,” suggested
Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll have the boys put one in right away,”
said the genial captain.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the Good News was being made
ready for its thousand mile flight to Atkinson,
Tim wired Carson that he was on his way
with the plates and would arrive about noon
the next day.</p>

<p class='c008'>At one a. m. Tim and Dugan sped away
from the Nogales field and their friends of
the border patrol. Dawn found them well on
their way toward Atkinson and at 11:30
o’clock Tim sighted his home field.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they taxied up to the apron, Tim
found Carson waiting for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The managing editor had ordered a dark
room for developing the plates rigged up at
the field and in less than half an hour, a complete
set of pictures were on their way to
the News office while another set, still damp,
were placed on board a special plane to be
rushed to Chicago where they were to be
placed on the telephoto wires.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had written the story of his adventure
while Dugan had handled the controls and the
story of his flight and the pictures of the
rebel leader were on the front page of the
first afternoon edition of the News—a clean
beat over every other paper in the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was preparing to leave the field when
Dugan stopped him,</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you spare a minute?” he asked, his
voice low and tense. He was evidently laboring
under great emotion and Tim followed him
toward the field and away from the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t forgotten how you saved me the
day the good will tour ended here,” hastened
Dugan, “nor what you’ve done this time and
I’ll repay you now. You’ve heard of the Sky
Hawk?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim nodded, waiting for the other to go on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know who he is,” went on Dugan, his
voice hoarse from emotion. “He’s a former
German ace, a great flyer, but obsessed with
the idea that by plundering the air lines he
can amass a great fortune and eventually attack
America from the air. It’s a crazy dream—a
wild one—but he’s sure raising hob while
he’s free.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He certainly is,” agreed Tim. “Who is it,
Dugan?” He waited for the answer, hardly
breathing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The daredevil’s lips started to move. Then
he glanced toward the sky where a heavy
humming drifted down.</p>

<p class='c008'>A plane shot through the clouds, whipped
around and headed in for the field. The crescendo
of its motor was deafening; conversation
was impossible. Dugan screamed something
at Tim but the words were inaudible.
Then he started running along the field in
front of the hangers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim yelled after him but his words were
lost in the storm of noise as the plane
skimmed over the field. The flying reporter
screamed until he thought his lungs would
burst. Dugan, running toward the Good
News, was sprinting directly into the path of
the incoming plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a blur of light, a form hurtling
through the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pilot of the plane leaped from his ship.
There was something familiar in his build—in
his stride. When they reached Dugan he
was beyond help and Tim stared across the
body of the daredevil into the hard eyes of
Kurt Blandin.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c009'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Later in the day Kurt Blandin stalked into
the News office and went directly to Tim’s
desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too bad about Dugan,” he said, but there
was no pity in his words. “I didn’t see him
until we struck. I’d thought of bringing the
air circus back here, but I’m not so sure about
it now. The accident will give us kind of a
black eye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t seem to be very sorry about
what happened to Dugan,” snapped Tim, his
eyes steely and his lips drawn in hard lines.
“And Blandin, I don’t think we want you
around here. There are a lot of things you
are going to have to explain. I’ve got a few
suspicions about you that aren’t very pleasant—Sky
Hawk!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The last words fairly ripped between Tim’s
lips. Tensed, the flying reporter watched their
effect on Blandin. The head of the Ace air
circus swayed like a slender reed in the wind,
but there was no change in the mask-like expression
of his face. Perhaps his eyes shifted
slightly, but that was all. He laughed, a cold,
nerve-chilling laugh that shocked Tim’s finer
sensibilities.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re crazy, Murphy,” replied Blandin
and before Tim could reply, turned and
hurried from the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>For half an hour Tim remained at his desk,
mulling over the events of the last months.
Only a few hours before he had been so near
the solution—so near to learning the identity
of the Sky Hawk. If Dugan could only talk,
but Dugan’s lips were stilled forever.</p>

<p class='c008'>The daredevil’s words about the German
ace came back to him and he went into the
library in the News building and sat down
before a large file. Slowly he thumbed through
the orderly stack of pictures with their descriptive
stories attached. Back through the
years he went as he rejected first one picture
and then another.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly he stopped. The picture in his
hand was familiar. A face was smiling up at
him from the glossy print, a German fatigue
cap was set at a jaunty angle, there was a
slight scar over one eye—it was familiar and
yet unfamiliar. It looked like Kurt Blandin,
yet it was unlike Kurt Blandin. It might have
been Kurt ten years before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hastily Tim read the short paragraph of
descriptive matter attached. The picture in
his hand was that of Max Reuter, one of the
greatest of German aces, who had been
brought down behind the Allied lines just before
the close of the war. Shell-shocked,
Reuter had been held in a prison camp until
the close of the war and then released.</p>

<p class='c008'>The clipping told little more of importance,
but to Tim it had provided a world of information.
The whole puzzle fitted together. Dugan’s story,
even without him, was complete,
and he hurried from the library and started
toward the municipal airport.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim had a premonition of danger and when
he reached the field was not surprised to see
Hunter run toward him the minute he came
through the gate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tim, Tim,” cried the field manager. “The
Sky Hawk has struck! He’s wrecked our eastbound
express plane and looted its cargo!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where?” asked Tim with a numbness of
heart that seemed to weigh him down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“East of Montour. The report just came
in. It couldn’t have happened more than an
hour ago. Ralph’s over on the line now warming
up your ship. Will you help us out?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim nodded, hastened into the office for a
suit of coveralls and in five minutes was speeding west.
Less than an hour later they were
scudding to a landing on a field where the
remains of the eastbound express were only
a blackened heap.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a simple story. The country was
sparsely settled. A forced landing by the plane,
a pounce by the waiting Sky Hawk, a dead
pilot, a flaming plane with empty express
compartments. The marks of the Sky Hawk’s
plane were plainly visible in the snow, even
his footprints could be discerned. But that was
all There were no fingerprints, nothing more
than the tracks in the snow. It looked like a
hopeless quest when Ralph, poking around in
the wreckage of the plane, picked up a bit of
metal. It was a small piece of copper, corroded,
strangely so.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without explaining his action to Tim, he
pocketed it and they prepared for the return
flight to Atkinson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Find out anything?” demanded Hunter
who was waiting for them when they landed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not much,” said Ralph, “but I’m going
to ride the westbound plane tomorrow morning.
Maybe we’ll know more then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s this theory about the Sky Hawk
you’re working on?” asked Tim when they
were alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s hardly a theory,” admitted Ralph.
“A hunch maybe, but not a theory. Look at
this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He pulled the chunk of corroded copper
from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s one of the cabin fittings,” said Tim
recognizing the piece from the wrecked
plane, “but what of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing much,” replied Ralph, “except it
holds the secret of the Sky Hawk’s power.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What! You’re crazy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I’m not crazy. It’s as plain as day.
You wait and see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll wait, all right,” agreed Tim. “Either
you’re awful bright or I’m awfully dumb.
But this is your show. You must have a good
idea of how the Sky Hawk is bringing down
these planes. Here’s luck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next morning found them at the field,
ready for the departure of the westbound express.
Hunter, worried and anxious, was on
hand. Every plane which the Sky Hawk destroyed
meant a loss of $25,000 and he could
see a year’s profits gone in a week unless
someone solved the secret of the Sky Hawk’s
power.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was warming up the Good News but
turned for a final word from Ralph.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fly high and keep well behind us,” instructed
his chum. “If anything goes wrong
with our ship, cut your motor, listen for the
hum of another plane, but don’t try to follow
it. Beat it for the ground and pull what’s left
of us clear of the machine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And don’t,” he added as an after thought,
“dive through any queer looking clouds which
may be near our plane if we’re struck down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With that Ralph hurried into the cockpit
of the waiting express ship where he crowded
in beside the pilot. In another minute both
planes were winging their way into the west,
the motors barking in the cold winter air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trip was uneventful and four hours
later the planes roared down on the snow covered
field at Lytton, the western terminal of
the transcontinental’s southwestern division.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too clear. We need clouds to catch the
Sky Hawk,” was the only explanation Ralph
would make when Tim asked him about the
trip.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next day Ralph looked at the winter
sky, studded with scurrying wind-swept
clouds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll go with the express,” he informed
Hunter over the phone. “The Sky Hawk will
strike today and we want to be on the job.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph lapsed into a grim silence as Tim and
the pilot of the express ship prepared their
planes for the takeoff on the eastbound trip.
Within a few hours, perhaps minutes, the
Sky Hawk would strike again. Just where
and how he could only guess. He was pitting
his nerve and brains against the craft of a
master crook. The decision was in the balance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph conferred with Tim for a moment
before he crowded into the cockpit of the express
plane. Then the two ships whirled over
the snow and into the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>An hour, two hours elapsed and the planes
were speeding over the desolate Rock river
country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim, above and behind the mail, suddenly
saw the express plane wobble unsteadily and
then drop away in a sickening dive. Remembering
the instructions Ralph had given him,
he cut the motor of his own craft, and glided
noiselessly through the broken clouds. He
thought he heard the faint hum of a motor—a
higher pitched note than that of the express
plane’s engine. It was gone in a second and
he turned his attention to the express plane,
fluttering helplessly toward the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>With motor on full, he crashed downward
through the clouds in a screaming power dive.
Every strut on the Good News shrilled
its protest but he held the nose down. He must
reach the ground with the express; must be
able to help Ralph and the express pilot if
they needed his assistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The express was limping toward a small
clearing and Tim, now under it, leveled off
and made a fast landing. A ground loop
slowed his speed and he was running toward
the express plane when it banged down into
the snow, its landing gear crumpling as the
pilot made clumsy attempt to land. The plane
flipped over on its nose and a figure was
thrown clear of the wreckage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim reached the limp form on the snow.
It was Ralph! But there was no time to ascertain
how badly his chum was injured. There
was a sizzling flash, a roar, and the motor
of the express was enveloped in a mass of
flame. Tim plunged on and under the overturned
fuselage. There, still strapped in his
seat, he found the unconscious pilot. With
anxious hands he unfastened the safety belt
and dragged the man away from the flaming
craft.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he returned to Ralph, he found his
chum gasping for air but otherwise unhurt.
Together they worked to bring the express
pilot back to consciousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened?” demanded Tim.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Sky Hawk almost got us,” said
Ralph, his voice husky and unnatural. “Another
ten seconds and our goose would have
been cooked. Here, let’s get this chap in the
Good News. We’ve got to get him to a doctor
quick. I’ll tell you all about it on the way to
Atkinson.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When they were safely on their way to the
home field, Ralph explained what had happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He gassed us,” he said simply. “That’s
the secret of his power to send planes and
pilots to their destruction. He only strikes
on cloudy days when he can hide in the clouds.
Just before his intended victim comes along,
he releases the gas in the clouds. The unsuspecting
pilot runs right into the gas and puff!
That’s all there is to it. Simple, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim was speechless with the horror of the
Sky Hawk’s method.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simple, yes,” he managed to say, “but terrible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll admit that,” grinned Ralph, and after
tomorrow, if the weather’s cloudy, there
won’t be any more Sky Hawk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That we’ll get the Sky Hawk. Now that
we know his methods, we have the upper
hand. This terror of the skies is about at the
end of his string.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When they landed at Atkinson a doctor
quickly brought the express flyer back to
consciousness although he was rushed to a
hospital for treatment to check the ravages
of the gas which he had breathed. Ralph had
been lucky and the slight whiff he had gotten
had knocked him out only temporarily with
no lasting danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reported to Hunter, studied the
weather forecasts for the next day, and completed
their simple preparations for the capture
of the Sky Hawk.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morning edition of the News carried
a carefully worded story how a special plane
was to leave Atkinson that morning on a
dash across the plains with a heavy shipment
of specie needed by a bank at the western terminal
of the division. The $1,000,000 plane,
the paper called it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Tim and Ralph wheeled the Good
News from the hangar that morning, a truck
was coming through the main gate with uniformed
policemen on the running boards. It
was the work only of a minute to transfer the
two dummy specie chests, heavy iron-bound
boxes, from the truck to the cabin of the
Good News. They were leaving nothing to
chance for the Sky Hawk might have accomplices
on the field.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a word with Hunter, Tim gunned the
motor of the Good News and they raced
across the field and into the air in quest of
the Sky Hawk. Both boys were concentrating
on the task ahead.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they neared the Rock River country
Ralph nudged his companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better put on the gas masks,” he warned.
“The clouds are heavy ahead of us; just the
place for the Sky Hawk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They donned the gas protectors, ready for
the Sky Hawk to strike. Ahead of them
loomed a cloud, grayish-green in color.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph signed for Tim to cut the motor.
They soared silently. To their right and
ahead of them they could hear the sound of
another plane. Tim turned on his motor and
ruddered hard to the right. All around them
were the grayish-green clouds of gas. The
Sky Hawk had laid a careful trap for the
specie plane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly they broke through the clouds.
Just ahead of them a sleek, black monoplane
was loafing in the sky. Its pilot, startled at
the sudden appearance of the Good News, was
caught unawares, and they were almost on
him before he could rev up his motor.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they roared down on the monoplane,
they caught a glimpse of the pilot, his face
covered with a hideous mask to protect him
from the gas clouds which he had scattered
through the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the Sky Hawk, the terror of the airways!</p>

<p class='c008'>With quickening pulse, Tim set himself to
the task of riding the Sky Hawk to earth.
He knew his plane was faster than that of
the aerial bandit, but could he match his skill
with the enemy and force him to earth?</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a puff of smoke under the
fuselage of the Sky Hawk’s plane and another
of the gray-green clouds took form. But Tim
and Ralph were protected from the gas and
they drove through the cloud in a burst of
speed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Sky Hawk looked around, plainly
alarmed. He had evidently believed their, first
appearance pure luck but their escape this time
was no such thing and the sky bandit realized
that he was cornered. He could fight or run
and either way the odds were against him for
the Good News was too speedy for his craft.
The tables were turned on the Sky Hawk.
For the first time he found the odds against
him and he chose to run.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a game to Tim’s liking and he roared
down on the tail of the black monoplane. Both
Tim and Ralph were armed but they hesitated
to use their guns except as a last resort.</p>

<p class='c008'>On and on they roared, first zig-zagging
to the right, then to the left, up, then down,
always on the tail of the sky Hawk, driving
him ever nearer the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Desperate, the masked bandit in the black
plane turned on them and bullet after bullet
ripped through the air as he blazed away at
Tim and Ralph with a sub-machine gun. It
was dangerous work now, but Tim handled
the Good News in masterful fashion relentlessly
teasing the Sky Hawk into shooting at
them when they had him at a disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally the sky bandit threw away his
gun, his ammunition exhausted. Tim saw the
gesture and steeled himself for the end. Whatever
its outcome it would come quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Sky Hawk threw his plane into a crazy,
twisting climb that threatened to pull the
motor out of the ship. Tim outguessed him
and climbed two feet to the bandit’s one. Two,
three, four, five thousand feet they clawed
their way into the sky, the Sky Hawk trying
frantically to escape his pursuers for in the
grimfaced flying reporters he could read his
finish unless escape came soon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ralph had put together the tangled webs
which put them on the Sky Hawk’s trail. Now
it was up to Tim to bring about the end of
the career of the gangster of the airways.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hang on,” yelled Tim as he pushed the
throttle to the end of its arc. The song of
the motor deepened and the Good News quivered
as it felt the full power of the 500 horse
power engine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Good News dropped down on the Sky
Hawk’s ship like an avenging eagle. It
swooped low, ready for the kill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Closer and closer came the motor-maddened
planes, each pilot intent on the destruction of
the other. Then, too late to escape, the Sky
Hawk guessed Tim’s plan but before he could
move or throw his plane into a spin, there was
the crash of wood and the scream of wires.</p>

<p class='c008'>Half of the upper wing of the monoplane
crumpled as Tim raked his landing gear
through it. The propeller shivered into a
thousand pieces and the motor raced madly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim and Ralph, peering from their plane,
saw the black craft pause in mid-air for a
moment. In that fleeting second they saw the
Sky Hawk half rise in his cockpit and rip
the gas mask from his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Kurt Blandin and in the anger-marked
face Tim recognized the likeness to
Max Reuter, the German ace. The mystery
was solved, the puzzle fitted and Blandin
punctuated its completion with a final show
of bravado as he raised clenched fists toward
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the black plane fell away in a tight
spin. Blandin made no effort to escape and a
thousand feet above the ground the wings
collapsed and the Sky Hawk crashed to his
death.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tim swung the Good News in a great
circle, then headed for Atkinson. The Sky
Hawk was gone; the airways were clear
once more.</p>
